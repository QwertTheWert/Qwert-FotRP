The woman bids the contenders a good day and asks to speak with them for a moment. She introduces herself as Kas Xi Rai, a Ruby Phoenix Tournament enthusiast and flashes a metal pin hidden beneath her robes as she says this. The pin bears the sigil of the Golden League, a famous crime syndicate first formed in the distant nation of Minkai with strong ties to the city of Goka. Anyone familiar with Goka, Minkai, or the events of the last Ruby Phoenix Tournament readily recognizes the symbol of the Golden League and knows that whatever this gang of rogues wants, it certainly isn’t on the straight and narrow.</p>\n<p>Kas Xi Rai keeps the conversation light and airy as she innocently asks the player characters what they think of their competition and how they believe they’ll fare in the tournament. She doesn’t openly talk about her affiliation with the Golden League or introduce her accomplices—highly trained Golden League toughs known locally as “xuns”—and she respectfully listens to the characters as they answer her leading questions.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>“The competition certainly is fierce,” Kas Xi Rai says with a low whistle. “Quite exciting that it’s a double-elimination tournament this year, though. That means that even if you lose the first round, you’re still in the running. It might even be easier that way, come to think of it, right? That is, if you’re in the loser’s bracket from the get go, you just have to beat second-rate teams until the very end. Not a bad deal.</p>\n<p>“As a matter of fact,” she continues, “and this is a bit silly, but have you made any bets on the outcome of the tournament yet? I have, and let me tell you, there’s a lot of money to be made. It’s actually quite the... coincidence, running into you here today. Because I made a pretty hefty bet—and I mean no offense by this—that your team would lose the first round of the tournament. Funny, right? Now, getting a better look at you, I’m having my doubts... Perhaps such a bet was foolish, I’m thinking now. Unless, that is, you’d be interested in striking a deal?” </p>\n</section>\n<p>If she hasn’t yet lost her audience by this point, Kas Xi Rai drops the insinuations and lays out her offer in plain terms: if the player characters throw their first match of the tournament proper (not an exhibition match), she promises them a cut of her winnings—20,000 gp in all. If this isn’t enough, she sweetens the deal and says that she’ll also teach the player characters some “intriguing” martial arts techniques if they go along with her plan. This grants the party access to the Golden League xun archetype (page 76).</p>\n<p>The player characters stand to make quite a bit of money if they agree to Kas Xi Rai’s terms and follow through on the deal, but throwing the first match takes away the safety net of the loser’s bracket, meaning the characters can’t lose any other match or they’ll lose the whole tournament.</p>\n<p>It’s up to the players whether or not they want to go along with this illicit deal. If they agree, then Kas Xi Rai shakes their hands and gives them some information on Winter’s Roar, their first opponents, to help them convincingly lose the match without making it look like a setup. She offers to train them in the ways of the xun before the tournament, meaning any characters who wish to do so can retrain any archetype they might already have in exchange for taking the Golden League xun archetype. Once the characters follow through on their end of the bargain, Kas Xi Rai pays the party as promised.</p>\n<p>Through clever wordplay and perhaps a successful DC 36 Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation check, the player characters might be able to learn about Winter’s Roar or the team throwing the match without agreeing to Kas Xi Rai’s deal. Alternatively, the player characters can succeed at one of these checks to convince Kas Xi Rai to pay them half the promised 20,000 gp up front. In either case—or if the characters otherwise betray her in any way—Kas Xi Rai feels bitterly spurned and brings along two more xuns with her when she attempts to burglarize the characters’ domiciles on the sixth night of the tournament (page 51). Creatures: Kas Xi Rai and her underlings have no interest in fighting at this point and politely excuse themselves if the player characters reject her proposal. If the player characters insist on fighting, the three criminals hold their own and fight with particularly nasty tactics, reasoning that permanently injuring the player characters here is as good a way as any to ensure the characters don’t win their first round.</p>\n<p>If Kas Xi Rai is incapacitated or the two xuns are taken down, any remaining foes flee for their lives. If arrested, Kas Xi Rai has a few bribes and favors she can call in to avoid hard time. The player characters are destined to have one more run-in with these rogues during this adventure (page 51), so however this meeting is resolved, it’s important that Kas Xi Rai makes a strong impression on the players.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Creatures</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.AfiC9jfnSc99V5Zc]{Kas Xi Rai}</strong></li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.Bec1WZp0eGcCkM5h]{Master Xuns (2)}</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"XMtSKCIxhsCSKmUd":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.YuRymvRy2DsmqSx6"},"cf":{"id":"temp_lhqqz4oyaj"}}}

Fight!}</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Hao Jin, the sorcerer also known as the Ruby  Phoenix, earned her place in legend as a collector  of exceedingly powerful and historically significant  items from across Golarion. For reasons alternately  altruistic and enigmatic, Hao Jin often wove entire  cities or regions into her own miniature plane of  existence hidden inside an innocuous tapestry. Before  her disappearance from the Material Plane over 300  years ago, she placed the <em>Hao Jin Tapestry</em>, along with  much of her collection, in the keeping of the Grand  Church of Abadar in Goka.  </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In accordance with Hao Jin’s will, the church of  Abadar in Goka founded the Ruby Phoenix Tournament  over 300 years ago after its members concluded Hao  Jin had died. The church offers some of Hao Jin’s vast  collection of priceless relics and legendary magic items  as prizes for one of the greatest competitions Golarion  has ever seen, attracting contenders from around the  globe with the chance to take one treasure from the  Ruby Phoenix’s incredible vault of wonders. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Cheating is far from uncommon at the Ruby  Phoenix Tournament, but the previous decade’s  competition was one of the most disruptive in history,  when vengeful disqualified competitors enacted a  conspiracy of kidnapping, sabotage, and attempted  murder. Only the efforts of the eventual winners  saved the event from total disaster. With the hopes  of preventing a similar catastrophe this year, Hao  Jin—who has returned from her sojourn across the  multiverse and presides as the grand judge for this  decade’s tournament—has set forth added strictures.  First among her restrictions was the prequalifying  event on Bonmu, which whittled down the competitors  to a far more reasonable number: just eight teams. Her  second restriction is likewise new to the Ruby Phoenix  Tournament: before a team enters the tournament,  its members must obtain the willful sponsorship of a  Gokan power broker. This provides the competitors  with enough coin to afford the high price that comes  with being in the spotlight (participating in a world  tournament is far from cheap), and ensures that a Gokan native personally vouches for each team’s character and adherence to the tournament rules.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The time for the Ruby Phoenix Tournament draws near. During this adventure, the player characters get the chance to face off against their rivals to earn the title of Ruby Phoenix Champions. Before the contenders can defeat their final team and claim the trophy, however, Hao Jin’s rival— Syndara the Sculptor—pulls the lever on his vile schemes to disrupt the tournament and enact his revenge, throwing Goka into chaos.</p>\n<section class=\"info\">\n<h4 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>CHAPTER 1 SYNOPSIS</strong></h4>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The contenders have made it to Goka and have qualified to participate in the Ruby Phoenix Tournament. Before the tourney begins, however, the characters need to pay the historically prohibitive costs associated with participating in this year’s main event. To do that, each team must impress one of Goka’s wealthiest and most powerful elite. The contenders have 7 days before bidding begins to explore Goka and impress their potential sponsors. At the end of the week, the contenders all take part in one final round of exhibition matches to make any last impressions on the patrons. Each team then selects their patron of choice based on what each benefactor bids to aid the team members during the tournament.</p>\n</section>\n<blockquote>\n<h4 style=\"text-align:justify\">Subpages</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-journal-entry.FqNpvV6eZBP6sDph]{Getting Started}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-journal-entry.YuRymvRy2DsmqSx6]{Influencing Patrons}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-journal-entry.zqArRBoJomDI9Ch9]{Exploring Goka}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-journal-entry.okj1wvY4woW6VMSs]{Events Around Goka}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-journal-entry.NRGDkf2g9e3RgDM2]{Exhibition Showcase}</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>","img":null,"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"XMtSKCIxhsCSKmUd":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"type":"base"},"cf":{"id":"temp_h6op93co1je"}}}

Each tower is constructed of varicolored porcelain inlaid with a dizzying array of magical icons. The academy features prominently in Goka’s magic item exports and book trade. Currently, the school is graduating its first small class from a newly constructed tower, where professors teach the bevy of new techniques brought back by Hao Jin when she returned to Goka a few years ago. In honor of the Ruby Phoenix Tournament as well as the graduation, the Five Pillars Academy also hosts a festival of magical displays. Competing teams have each been invited to the academy during the week for a short exhibition.</p>\n<p>Just two patrons are present at the academy’s jubilee when the player characters arrive: Malaika Tao and Lord Aldunar Unmar. Hao Jin, incidentally, is also present as a guest of honor. In a short speech to all the gathered guests, Tao explains that the new department, the Tower of Balance, focuses on the training of unconventional magical gifts, especially sorcerers. Rather than focusing on texts, students here are given space to channel their emotions and explore the personal nature of their gifts with master sorcerers who have made similar self-discoveries.</p>\n<p>One other team of tournament contenders is also on the scene at the same time as the player characters: the Speakers to the Winds, a group of academics from the Magaambya Academy in central Garund. When Tao notices the player characters and the Speakers to the Winds, she invites them all to join her onstage, then introduces them to the crowd. She then asks the teams if they would be interested in a short demonstration of some of the most promising students’ sorcerous techniques. If they comply, the player characters face off against a group of four sorcerers (the Speakers to the Winds fight a separate group) and then have a short time afterward to mingle with the sponsors. The demonstration calls for the player characters to demonstrate their preferred techniques for dealing with powerful sorcerer spells aimed at them. They can respond in any manner they wish, although the students (and the patrons) are most interested in spells that counteract the originals or that render the example spells ineffective.</p>\n<p><strong>Creatures: </strong>The fight takes place in a cleared open courtyard outside. To prevent damage to the school or injuries to the onlookers, Hao Jin places four powerful walls of force around the battlefield, essentially creating a 50-foot-by-50-foot cage for the characters and students to fight in.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>creaTURES</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.AT0wT1yLpDOCpARw]{Sixth Pillar Students (4)}</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Once the player characters have incapacitated three of the students or 4 rounds have passed (whichever comes first), Tao calls off the demonstration and thanks everyone involved. She asks the audience to enjoy the rest of the festival then quietly invites the player characters and the Speakers to the Winds to recuperate and enjoy some refreshments in a quiet faculty lounge.</p>\n<p>1 Influence Round: In the lounge, the player characters have about a half-hour (1 round) to Discover information about or Influence the patrons here: Malaika Tao and Lord Aldunar Unmar.

Styled like a pagoda with ten enormous levels, the Aerie houses over 500 of Goka’s drake inhabitants and is the launching point for nearly all of the city’s famous drake races.</p>\n<p>The characters are greeted by attendants at the door of Icefang Aerie, who bid the contenders to go upstairs to the third floor where their hosts await. Although Malaika Tao, General Kaso Hida, and Lady Qiu May Shai are supposed to be at the rookery, the player characters find the building’s first two floors empty except for roosting drakes. Upon reaching the third floor, they see the following.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>Four humanoid fighters in furs and hide armor—the members of team Winter’s Roar—stand in the center of the massive but empty room that composes the entire third floor of Icefang Aerie.

An open wall to the north leads to a balcony where drakes can take off or land.</p>\n<p>Another team, Winter’s Roar, has upset the drakes by peppering them with probing questions about their weaknesses and information about linnorms without any offer of compensation for their time. The agitated drakes now feel they must make all the interloping Ruby Phoenix Tournament entrants pay until they learn to properly respect their hosts. If the characters offer a bribe of at least 6,000 gp and apologize on behalf of Winter’s Roar, the drakes are calmed and give them no further trouble. A series of no fewer than three successful DC 38 Diplomacy, Deception, or Intimidation checks and some excellent roleplaying can likewise quell the drakes’ ire. Otherwise, the drakes soon attack all the humanoids in the area, refusing to distinguish between their antagonists and the player characters.</p>\n<p><strong>Creatures: </strong>Six of the drakes split off from the larger group to attack the player characters, while the six others fight Winter’s Roar on the other side of the room.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>CREATURES</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.ElRBfbppj6w8uhyK]{Drake Courser (6)}</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Patrons Emerge: Once just two drakes remain or all the humanoid competitors seem handily beaten, someone near one of the stairwells claps their hands loudly and shouts something in Draconic that stops the drakes dead in their tracks. Three of the potential sponsors—Malaika Tao, General Kaso Hida, and Lady Qiu May Shai—emerge from the shadows, having been enshrouded by illusions both mundane and magical. The patrons reveal that the drakes had previously been instructed to confront the humanoids and that this encounter was a test to see how the teams would fare. The various patrons might feel more or less disposed toward the characters’ Influence attempts depending on if the characters fought the drakes or managed to dispel their rage. In fact, Hida and Shai made bets to this effect, respectively, and they good-naturedly exchange a few gold pieces depending on the outcome of the encounter.</p>\n<p>1 Influence Round: The player characters have less than an hour (1 round) to Influence or Discover information about the three patrons here, who might be alternately impressed or disgusted by the characters’ handling of the drake encounter. Hida, for instance, appreciates a good fight and sound tactics, whereas Shai hoped that the competitors would resolve the situation peacefully.</p>\n<p>Treasure: If the player characters either resolved the encounter peacefully or made a spectacular show of trouncing the drakes, Malaika Tao thanks them for the performance with three doses of dragon bile poison, which they are free to use as they like (including during the tournament).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>TREASURES</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf2e.equipment-srd.6swrLimere2nZtz9]{3 doses of dragon bile poison}</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"XMtSKCIxhsCSKmUd":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.YuRymvRy2DsmqSx6"},"cf":{"id":"temp_t5vaum4jlmd"}}}

Upscale establishments accept wagers with the house for up to 500 gp, and the Golden League and other rich backers fund gray market bookies who accept wagers of up to 2,000 gp. Finding a highest-stakes bookie requires either a referral from a current client or member (such as Kas Xi Rai of the Golden League) or a successful DC 35 Diplomacy check to Gather Information. The most readily available high-stakes bookie is <strong>Kyubia Bone-Pillar</strong> (LE female wayang bookie 12), who uses the looser regulation of Goka’s Undermarket to run her gambling hall how she likes. Kyubia runs a small stall not far from the arena. She likes to make snide jokes about the matches she accepts bids on and also sells spiced mushroom spears.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px\">Betting odds and thus payouts are determined by teams’ seeds in the tournament, which were decided during the prequalifier on Bonmu and are denoted on the tournament bracket diagram on page 31. The player characters are seeded 1st, the Lightkeepers 2nd, and so on. The payout for betting on a team depends on the difference between that team’s seed and the seed of their opponents. Betting on a team seeded higher (such as 1st or 2nd) than their opponents (like 7th or 8th) results in a lower payout than the inverse, betting on a lower-seeded team.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px\">For example, if the characters bet that the Speakers to the Winds (seeded 4th) will win their match on Day 1 against the Biting Roses (seeded 5th), their payout would be 1 gp for every 2 gp they wagered, since the Speakers’ seed is 1 higher than the Biting Roses. This might seem a little confusing because the highest seed (1st) has the lowest number, but just keep that in mind for wagers; it is otherwise irrelevant to the competition.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:643.891px\">This adventure assumes the player characters have been seeded 1st. If they did not, devise a reason to explain why they are in this slot (perhaps something happened on Bonmu during the prequalifier that has caused positive rumors to circulate about the player characters) or be prepared to make significant changes to the tournament bracket throughout the adventure. Likewise, to keep things simple, a team’s seed doesn’t change during the tournament for the purposes of making wagers.

The contract also serves as a waiver; the undersigned agree that permanent injury or death are a very real possibility in the tournament, and the tournament staff can’t be held liable if such a tragedy occurs.</p>\n<p>The sparsely attended occasion is nonetheless marked with a bit of fanfare. Lanterns line the plaza as the teams approach a stone podium in a meticulously maintained garden space, and Aldunar Unmar hands out firecrackers that explode with colorful smoke. Lady Qiu May Shai congratulates the teams on making it this far and thanks them for the splendid show today. She explains what they are about to sign, and reads aloud all the rules for fighting in the Ruby Phoenix Tournament. For the sake of convenience, the Tournament Rules are printed on page 32 in Chapter 2, closer to the text of the tournament itself. To make it easier for your players to remember the tournament’s rules, you should probably share the rules with them at the beginning of the first game session in which they fight in the tournament, rather than now. It is likely safe to assume the player characters sign the contract and waiver regardless of the rules, since failing to do so means they forfeit their place in the tournament.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Influence Round: </strong>As each team approaches the podium to sign the contract, they are each given one final opportunity to impress the assembled patrons. As Archbanker Malii hands the contenders a quill, Lady Qiu May Shai, speaking for all the patrons, asks each team a single question, “What will you do if you win the Ruby Phoenix Tournament?”</p>\n<p>The player characters are neither the first nor the last team to sign the tournament contracts, so they can listen to a few other teams’ answers before being asked to provide their own.</p>\n<p>Syu Tak-nwa speaks cryptically for the Lightkeepers in a grave voice: “After we complete our mission, our names will be spoken of in legends for centuries to come, and we will take our own piece of history as our prize.” Most of the patrons look at each other quizzically, some of them shuffling their feet uneasily, but Lord Buken Tegora smirks and says to Tak-nwa, “From your reputation, I think you will.”</p>\n<p>Going down the line, Tino speaks next for his team, “If we win the tournament, my friends and I will have the glory of a once-in-a-decade victory—and that’s good enough for us!” This elicits slight smiles from nearly all of the patrons.</p>\n<p>Next is the player characters’ turn to speak. However they respond, allow one player to attempt a skill a check to Influence all of the patrons at once; this can be any skill check as long as the player comes up with a creative reason for why it should be valid. Compare the result of this skill check against the DC to Influence each of the prospective patrons with that particular skill. This is a single roll, but it can potentially Influence all five patrons if it is a skill that shows up in each patron’s Influence Skills line (such as Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation).</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"XMtSKCIxhsCSKmUd":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.YuRymvRy2DsmqSx6"},"cf":{"id":"temp_13lhdru735wa"}}}

Dappled shadows on the water change shapes strangely as a truly massive extraplanar portal inexplicably manifests in the sky above. The circular rift looks like a tear in the fabric of reality itself, a rippling black disc warping the very sky around it.</p>\n<p><strong>Creatures:</strong> As quickly as the portal forms, a group of mythological beasts—an ancient underworld dragon named Iagaara and three scaly kuns— emerges from the center of the eclipse. The dragon writhes in the sky as the kuns plummet into the bay below. Soon, all four begin attacking the city in their confused rage. Either to protect themselves or to impress their potential patrons, the player characters must fend off these monsters and save any citizens caught in the chaos.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Creatures</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.ZcqenYSBHxXPjnHC]{Iagaara}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.ZX4xARghlapC27h0]{Kuns (3)}</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Demiplane Weirdness: </strong>Syndara the Sculptor used dimension-spanning magic to create the rift that has cast Goka in shadow. In order to sow chaos in the days leading up to the Ruby Phoenix Tournament—and no doubt give his own team, the Lightkeepers, an edge against all rivals (including foolish heroes who would no doubt help save the city)—Syndara manifested an intersection between an underworld dragon’s infernal den, the dark depths of the ocean where kuns dwell, and the skies above Goka. While the monsters rage across the Gokan shoreline, the Lightkeepers relax in a distant inland teahouse.</p>\n<p>Any subsequent research into the phenomenon reveals that the portals were created by fell extraplanar energies and have something to do with a demiplane (the portal bears similar magical energies to the air rift that formed in the Empress Yin Opera House, page 17), but beyond that it is impossible for the characters to accurately determine the cause of the sudden eclipse.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"XMtSKCIxhsCSKmUd":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.YuRymvRy2DsmqSx6"},"cf":{"id":"temp_lhqqz4oyaj"}}}

Either way, the characters can’t get a sneak peek at the tournament venue or meet any of their potential patrons before the adventure begins in earnest.</p>\n<p>The Ruby Phoenix Tournament is only weeks away, but before the fighting begins, all competing teams must secure a patron from among Goka’s elite. These wealthy and powerful benefactors cover all fees associated with the tournament for their team plus food and lodging, provide their team a stipend for incidentals (including equipment), and manage other aspects outside the arena such as promoting the team and commissioning a team costume.</p>\n<p>None of this should come as a surprise to your players. Before beginning the adventure, you should read the Influencing Patrons section below, which explains how this chapter works, and summarize the rules to your players so everyone understands their goal of impressing patrons in the lead-up to the tournament and how to accomplish this. Establishing the rules at the adventure’s outset will make running this part of the adventure much easier.</p>\n<p>The player characters start the adventure gathered with the other contending teams at the Grand Bank of Abadar (page 11), where they all meet the potential patrons who will compete to sponsor the teams during the tournament. After the initial meet-and-greet at the Grand Bank, the characters are then free to explore Goka however they please. They can explore as many locations per day as you deem plausible, but you should try and spread out the influence rounds across the week so that the characters aren’t left with an unduly large chunk of free time before the exhibition showcase at the end of this chapter.</p>\n<p>Once you and your players are ready to begin the adventure, refer to page 11 in order to set the scene at the Grand Bank of Abadar. Here, Goka’s archbanker introduces the tournament contenders to their potential patrons, and the contenders have their first chance to impress one patron over food and drinks. The characters can then ask the archbanker any questions they have before being set loose on the city of Goka for the rest of the week. After 7 days exploring Goka and interacting with their potential patrons and rivals, the contenders must all convene at the Cliffside Court to complete a final exhibition round of fighting matches, after which the patrons bid on which team they would each like to sponsor during the tournament proper. Each team can choose which sponsor’s bid to accept.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>SIDEBAR</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-journal-entry.aSacHt2uALKkyRbB]{Sidebar: Foreshadowing the Sculptor}</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"XMtSKCIxhsCSKmUd":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.FqNpvV6eZBP6sDph"},"cf":{"id":"temp_h6op93co1je"}}}

As a child, Tino admired his older brother, Yuen, watching him for hours as Yuen trained in various fighting styles. Unfortunately, tragedy would strike shortly after Tino’s 10th birthday, when Yuen attempted to stop a number of local ruffians from stealing from the Tung family’s shop. Yuen received a fatal knife wound to his chest, though it was Tino whose heart fully broke; the surviving brother fell into a depression for months. Eventually, Tino’s parents convinced him to join a local fighting school in order to free himself from grief and perhaps in the process honor his older brother’s legacy.</p>\n<p>Tino joined the same school as Yuen, where he heard many tales from their teacher about his older brother. Tino returned day after day not to improve his skills, but to hear more stories. The teacher eventually had no more tales to tell, at which point Tino decided to commit himself to completing the training that his brother could not. Five years later, Tino mastered not only the same techniques that Yuen was learning, but several more. To continue walking in the footsteps of his older brother, Tino dedicated himself to master 101 unique fighting styles from across Golarion. He set off from home and traveled Quain to expand his knowledge.</p>\n<p>Tino traveled to Quain’s Dragon Temple and learned the teachings of Irori. During his stay, he befriended <strong>Takatorra </strong>(LN nonbinary tengu swordmaster), a fellow Quain native training at the same temple, and invited them to join him on his quest. In addition to their mastery of the sword (and their seemingly insatiable sweet tooth), Takatorra proved a capable strategist, able to analyze combatants and their weaknesses to better overcome them in combat. This ability proved useful when a greedy but kind-hearted highway bandit named<strong> Ji-Yook</strong> (N female kitsune ninja) attempted to steal Tino’s coin pouch. The two came to blows while Takatorra, nibbling a biscuit and watching from the sidelines, offered more commentary than encouragement. Tino, having never faced a ninja before, relished this fateful meeting with Ji-Yook. Likewise amused with their scrabble and ensuing stalemate, Ji-Yook accepted Tino’s offer as a traveling partner and brought along her friend, <strong>Yabin the Just</strong> (N male nagaji sorcerer), so named because of his elaborate personal credo and his habit of attempting to mediate disputes that have nothing to do with him.</p>\n<p>Since joining up, the group has continued their travels across Tian Xia, becoming good friends in the process. Tino is the group’s unofficial leader, inspiring the rest with his honorable heart and desire to see the good in others. Recently, the group earned the attention of Hao Jin and an invitation to the Ruby Phoenix Tournament, and Tino saw it as the perfect chance to learn techniques from beyond his nation’s shores. With the support of his friends, Tino entered the team, and the group made the journey to Goka.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>OPPONENTS</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.vvemDMKoyZxTdmNX]{Tino Tung}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.P8w1BGqwjwY4aH1b]{Ji-yook}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.s4nPt9qviWazo0Pp]{Takatorra}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.h3feptz0wq6gHHEU]{Yabin the Just }</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"XMtSKCIxhsCSKmUd":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.YuRymvRy2DsmqSx6"},"cf":{"id":"temp_eb82vavtgfc"}}}

The team’s leader, <strong>Urnak Lostwind </strong>(NG male half-orc viking) commands an admirable degree of loyalty from his companions. This is in no small part due to Urnak’s acceptance of the other members. All of Winter’s Roar, including Urnak himself, are outcasts of a sort, and in coming together the four have forged an unbreakable bond.</p>\n<p>Left for dead with his siblings at a young age, Urnak fled Belkzen for the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, eventually traveling through Irrisen and ending his journey in the Lands of the Linnorm Kings. In Irrisen, Urnak met <strong>Juspix Rammel </strong>(N male halfling witch), a halfling who had somehow gained powers like those of the local Jadwiga winter witches. This power had earned him only ire from other spellcasters, though, and so Juspix appreciated finding a friend in the traveling Urnak. In the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the two met <strong>Huldrin Skolsdottir </strong>(LN female human shieldmaiden) and <strong>Troff Frostknuckles </strong>(N male hobgoblin brawler). The former was a disgraced Ulfen warrior and the only surviving member of her clan. The latter had faced a similar situation after fleeing the slaughter of his own group. The two found kinship in each other and later in Urnak and Juspix.</p>\n<p>Since joining together, the fighters of Winter’s Roar have slowly worked toward their goal of each slaying a linnorm to earn the title of Linnorm Kings and claim their own kingdom. None have yet pursued an actual hunt, instead focusing on improving their skill to ensure they can earn their desired glory and power. When Urnak learned of the upcoming Ruby Phoenix Tournament, he saw it as a perfect opportunity to test their prowess and earn additional prestige and finances to aid with their new kingdoms. The group gathered their resources and made the dangerous trek across the Crown of the World to enter the tournament.</p>\n<p>In combat, Urnak unleashes a fury that empowers his blows with frost magic. Juspix uses his ice magic to manipulate the battlefield and isolate crucial targets. Huldrin holds the frontline, standing alongside Urnak or Troff, defending her fellow warriors. Troff makes use of his fancy footwork to vault around the battlefield, creating openings with his dizzying speed and striking with his enchanted gauntlets.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>OPPONENTS</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.9tmi0Y5ZVJYfp71I]{Urnak Lostwind}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.1GfVXN6bKgAlxYIv]{Huldrin Skolsdottir}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.PGAIgL7QuWRwenKR]{Juspix Rammel}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.efQMqPJDtdK3Batz]{Troff Frostknuckles}</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"XMtSKCIxhsCSKmUd":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.YuRymvRy2DsmqSx6"},"cf":{"id":"temp_eb82vavtgfc"}}}

To excite the crowd and narrate the fights for spectators without a good view of the arena, Hao Jin has hired a Gokan native named Tagada Emmi to emcee the tournament as well as the preliminary exhibition showcase. Emmi is well suited for the job—she has served as the announcer of dozens of drake races at the Icefang Aerie and has hosted more than her fair share of sporting events, both high-profile and commonplace. For the Ruby Phoenix Tournament, Emmi has chosen to wear red traditional Tian-Shu attire in honor of the Ruby Phoenix, and she has adopted her most excitable and enthusiastic persona (which, conveniently, is her natural disposition). She is bombastic, hyperbolic, and unnecessarily descriptive, filling in gaps in the action with open questions about the fighters’ next moves or what they could be thinking.

Now that all the teams have had a chance to acquaint themselves with the city of Goka and the tournament’s various patrons, the time has finally come for the patrons to bid on the teams they’d most like to sponsor during the tournament. But before that, the patrons want one final chance to see how the teams fare in an actual arena.</p>\n<p>To that end, each team is scheduled to take part in two fights: one against another team, and one against a pair of monsters. Both showcase fights take place in the grand areana (use the map on page 24), where all tournament matches take place. Whenever one or more teams is taken to the fighting grounds, the remaining six or seven teams are sequestered indoors in order to prevent them from seeing their competition in action before the tourney.

The immaculate and well-appointed private houses are in a typical Gokan style in order to give the visiting teams a glimpse of daily life in the city. The houses are identical in layout as well as accommodations. The floors and roofs are made of glazed tiles. The walls are made of stone halfway up the first story and then thick darkwood from there to the awnings. Each domicile measures roughly 2,000 square feet, with a single main entrance that leads to a broad courtyard surrounding a large fruit tree; the building itself surrounds the courtyard on three sides. Doorways from the courtyard lead to separate small sleeping rooms for each contender, a spacious living room with a small hearth, and—best of all—a communal bathing area with a small stone pool that overlooks the Cliffside Court and the bay beyond. Attendants are on hand at all hours to provide the contenders with hot water, meals from the communal kitchen, collapsible privacy screens, and anything else they might need during their stay.</p>\n<p>Unless they have arranged for accommodations elsewhere, all of the Ruby Phoenix Tournament contenders are expected to stay at the Ruby Village for the duration of the tournament. This makes it easy for the player characters to meet with other teams or even perform a bit of espionage, though they risk the usual penalties for breaking the law as long as they are in Goka, and the walled entrances to each house means some wall-scaling might be necessary. Throughout this chapter, all of the other teams stay at the Ruby Village, but after patrons are chosen many of the teams move to different housing.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Influence Round: </strong>Lady Qiu May Shai and Lady Xhai Zhia are both at the Ruby Village when the player characters first arrive.

Here is how it works.</p>\n<p>All the fighting teams are sent to dinner at a nearby high-class restaurant, where they can mingle while the patrons negotiate among themselves and coordinate their bids so that no one is left without a patron. Each fighting team is called upon one by one, and all the patrons interested in bidding on that team present their offers in quick succession. The team can then choose whichever patron whose offer the team finds most appealing. Each team can have only one patron, but each patron can sponsor any number of teams (or no teams at all). That said, in this adventure, each of the eight patrons ends up sponsoring a different team.</p>\n<p>The order in which the teams are called upon is said to be random, but for the purpose of this game the order is predetermined. The player characters’ team goes fourth in order, after Tino’s Toughest, the Lightkeepers, and the Biting Roses, who have secured Lady Yen Tsing Jurai, Lord Buken Tegora, and Lady Narswani Vangarath as their patrons, respectively. It’s up to you what types of items and boons these patrons offer their teams, but in general they should be relatively minor and shouldn’t affect the tournament as presented in Chapter 2.</p>\n<p>When the player characters meet with the patrons, the five remaining patrons bid on them. Each patron bids a certain amount of money, various magic items, and certain special boons depending on how many Influence Points the player characters managed to earn with that patron. To make it easier for your players to compare the offers, you might want to print or write all the applicable bids on a sheet of paper for the players to study. Your players can choose to accept the sponsorship of any patron whose bid they find most appealing, but they can choose only one patron. Once chosen, a patron can’t be changed.</p>\n<p><strong>Aftermath and Treasure: </strong>The characters receive everything their patron bid on them immediately. Once all the teams have accepted a patron, Hao Jin informs everyone that they have 1 week to prepare for the tournament. In the meantime, the fighters can continue to explore Goka, rest and relax, retrain if necessary, and make use of the payment from their new patron. After a week, each team will report back to the grand pavilion at the Cliffside Court, where the Ruby Phoenix Tournament will commence at noon sharp.</p>\n<p><strong>XP Award:</strong> Award each player character 80 XP as a story award for securing a patron. If the player characters have still not earned enough XP to level up to level 16, consider awarding enough additional XP to cover the deficit.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"XMtSKCIxhsCSKmUd":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.YuRymvRy2DsmqSx6"},"cf":{"id":"temp_13lhdru735wa"}}}

Yet, Syndara recognizes that he has limited opportunities to do so from the seat of his power, a demiplane of his own called the <em>Glass Lighthouse</em>. When Hao Jin announced that she would preside over this decade’s Ruby Phoenix Tournament, Syndara realized this was his chance to finally enact the downfall of his lifelong rival.</p>\n<p>Syndara used his limited planar capabilities to contact only the most formidable and vile Tian Xia natives, offering them great power and riches should they aid his mission. His search turned up four individuals whose souls are as wicked as his. <strong>Syu Tak-nwa</strong> (NE female Tian-Hwan white-haired witch), the last living descendent of an ancient line of Hwanggot-based witches, was an obvious first choice for Syndara’s team of fighters. With her help, Syndara located <strong>Ran-To </strong>(LE male frost goblin grappler) and promised the wandering goblin unimaginable strength in exchange for his service.</p>\n<p><strong>Shino Hakusa </strong>(LE female Tian-Shu assassin), a killer whose tactics were so ruthless that she was exiled from her familial clan of assassins, answered Syndara’s call with no hesitation. Finally, Syndara offered the last spot on his fighting team to <strong>Blue Viper </strong>(NE male ysoki poisoner), a depraved alchemist responsible for virulent outbreaks in no fewer than seven major cities.<br />With his roster complete, Syndara allowed the four to train and hone their abilities within his temporally dilated realm, the <em>Glass Lighthouse</em>. Over just a few weeks, the mercenaries gained years’ worth of fighting experience and developed a strong bond as companions in the pursuit of cruelty. Syu Tak-nwa became the acting leader and strategist. Under her guidance, the four fighters quietly murdered one of Hao Jin’s selected teams for the tournament pre-qualifier and pulled strings in Goka to replace the dead team as entrants in the tournament.</p>\n<p>Although the Lightkeepers’ powers are limited on the relatively stifling Material Plane, the four are still a formidable team of fighters. Syu Tak-nwa casts spells and hexes to weaken opponents, while Blue Viper achieves similar results with his poisons. Shino makes use of her speed to charge and harry enemy spellcasters and ranged fighters. These attacks create openings for Ran-To, allowing him to move in and subdue foes with his immense strength.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>OPPONENTS</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.ralfq1erKmoTMaAT]{Syu Tak-nwa}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.XH5wNiVeTRAN2p0d]{Blue Viper}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.PqGATmn9ZLwkUobY]{Shino Hakusa}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.XH5wNiVeTRAN2p0d]{Blue Viper}</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"XMtSKCIxhsCSKmUd":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.YuRymvRy2DsmqSx6"},"cf":{"id":"temp_eb82vavtgfc"}}}

Three teams have already made strong connections to three of the patrons. This fact should become immediately obvious to the player characters, leaving them with the chance to influence up to five different patrons to sponsor them in the tournament. (The available patrons has been limited to avoid overcomplicating the adventure.)</p>\n<p>The following influence stat blocks show all the pertinent details for the five patrons liable to sponsor the characters’ team. These stat blocks include a description of the patron, their Perception and Will modifiers in case those become relevant, the DCs to Discover information about them or Influence them with certain skills, the different gifts and boons the patron offers depending on how many Influence Points the party accrues with that patron, and additional details the player characters can exploit to influence the patrons.</p>\n<p><strong>Influence: </strong>The numbered Influence lines in each stat block describe what money, boons, or gifts the patron bids on the player characters’ team if they reach that Influence Point threshold by the time of the showcase auction (Bidding War on page 29). The thresholds are cumulative. For example, if the party has a total of 4 Influence Points with Malaika Tao by the time bidding starts, Malaika offers the player characters all of the money, items, and other perks listed under both the Influence 1 and Influence 4 entries in her stat block if they choose her as their patron. Unless they use the Discover activity (above) to glean such information, the players won’t know what each patron intends to bid at each threshold until bidding starts, but the patron’s background, interests, and vocation should give them some idea of what to expect. The players should likewise know that each patron’s Influence Point thresholds are 1, 4, and 8, so they can keep track of which thresholds they have met for which patrons.</p>\n<p><strong>Weaknesses and Resistances:</strong> Characters who play off of a patron’s Weaknesses entry to Influence them decrease the DC of the next Influence check against them by 2. Conversely, the DC increases by 2 for a character whose next Influence check aligns with the patron’s Resistances entry. At your discretion, particularly suitable or egregiously inappropriate Influence attempts might decrease or increase the DC of the next Influence check by 4 instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Bidding: </strong>In addition to the usual lines for an Influence stat block, the following stat blocks contain one additional entry at the end, Bidding, that explains which other fighting team the patron bids on if the player characters reject the patron’s offer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>PATRONS</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-journal-entry.rirc25htTMY5Mebl]{Malaika Tao}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-journal-entry.tbj1FkeuZqcAjHi5]{General Kaso Hida}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-journal-entry.ox7qLsQybWRFfgQN]{Lord Aldanar Unmar}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-journal-entry.G5CDGdEXgzslcIKH]{Lady Qiu May Shai}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-journal-entry.Zy1GfDsc54N3oqfp]{Lady Xhai Zhia}</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"XMtSKCIxhsCSKmUd":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.YuRymvRy2DsmqSx6"},"cf":{"id":"temp_1azue4ryqq9"}}}

At the end of the week, the teams participate in one final round of preliminary exhibition matches before the Ruby Phoenix Tournament begins. All sponsors watch this exhibition and—based on the fights as well as their previous interactions with the teams—bid against one another to sponsor the team of their choice. The sponsors’ bids include gold, magic items, and special perks to be used during or between tournament matches. The more the player characters influence a certain patron, the more that patron bids on them, providing even greater gifts and boons. A patron with no feelings at all toward the player characters’ team bids nothing on them. The characters can choose only one patron, so once the influenced patrons make their offers the players will have to think carefully about which patron they’d like to sponsor their team.</p>\n<p>Although each team can ultimately secure only one patron, it behooves the player characters to impress multiple patrons before the exhibition so that they can choose from multiple sets of gifts and boons. If the characters influence only one patron, they won’t have a choice and must accept that patron’s offer. If the characters somehow fail to influence any patrons, Lady Nai Yan Fei’s lady in waiting, Lady Qiu May Shai, sponsors them. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>SUBPAGES</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-journal-entry.vVtLOLHHLZNzIXhi]{Running Influence Rounds}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-journal-entry.VQJggcmkrTQsPwXE]{Potential Patrons}</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"XMtSKCIxhsCSKmUd":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.YuRymvRy2DsmqSx6"},"cf":{"id":"temp_h6op93co1je"}}}

The feline creatures are angoyangs, evil beings who rejoice in manipulation. They just stole a valuable dreas from a dramofir, who is intent on reclaiming his property. The player characters and their hosts hardly have time to react before the angoyangs dive behind the player characters. The dramofir, too incensed to distinguish bystander from foe, attacks the party, assuming them to be in league with the angoyangs.

Hao Jin’s old friend turned nemesis, an axiomite named Syndara the Sculptor, created the Glass Lighthouse centuries ago to serve as a tyrant’s playground. Before Syndara could complete the job, though, Hao Jin imprisoned the axiomite in his own demiplane.

While his fighters earned their place among the final eight teams, Syndara lured the kaiju Mogaru to Goka through a combination of magic and trickery, including the theft of an egg containing Mogaru’s presumed scion. Syndara used many powerful spells and rituals to coordinate Mogaru’s movement toward Goka, and in the process strained the already magically thin boundaries around the city to other planes of existence. If all goes according to plan, Mogaru will arrive in Goka before the final match of the tournament, at which point the bard Razu will draw him into the city with music while Syndara lures Hao Jin into a trap on the axiomite’s own demiplane, the Glass Lighthouse.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-top:var(--p-space,1em);width:649.531px\">More details about Syndara the Sculptor and his relationship to Hao Jin are revealed in the next adventure volume “King of the Mountain.” For the time being, your player characters will discover a number of strange phenomena that point to some external meddling, but provide little concrete or actionable evidence.

Agents of the Pathfinder Society won the previous tournament a decade ago while also thwarting the corrupt schemes of the Golden League crime syndicate. This year, Li is eager to expand the Society’s reputation by promoting memories of the last tourney and drawing new visitors to the Pathfinders’ Gokan headquarters.</p>\n<p>The player characters arrive at the Lantern Lodge at the same time as their friendly rivals, Tino’s Toughest. Tino and his friends are eager to learn more about Hao Jin’s famous treasures, and Tino and Takatorra in particular gush about their excitement with the player characters. Ji-yook and Yabin, on the other hand, offer respectful silence as they peruse the gallery of relics from the last tournament.</p>\n<p>Alongside the two fighting teams here are the tournament’s eight potential patrons. Besides the introduction at the Grand Bank of Abadar and the showcase exhibition, this is the only event at which all eight patrons are present.</p>\n<p><strong>The Pathfinder Chronicles:</strong> Li has filled the Lantern Lodge with memorabilia from the last decade’s tournament, including the villain Wu Jefeng’s magical adamantine staff and broken pieces of armor that once belonged to the Pathfinder heroes. More importantly, however, she has also included choice excerpts from the <em>Pathfinder Chronicles </em>that describe some of the potential prizes being offered to this year’s Ruby Phoenix Champions. The prizes themselves are all still within Hao Jin’s vast vault of treasures, but the <em>Chronicles </em>describe a few of them in fabulous, tantalizing detail. </p>\n<p>The guests can peruse the excerpts from the <em>Chronicles </em>themselves, but Amara Li is happy to expound on the excerpts herself. In particular, the chronicler describes the following five items from the Ruby Phoenix’s collection. (The player characters will receive the <em>sky-piercing bow </em>from Hao Jin at the beginning of Chapter 3. Likewise, the player characters gain access to the <em>Solar Jian II </em>during the next adventure, “King of the Mountain.” The other items are meant solely as inspiration so you can create a suitably incredible prize for the player characters to claim if they win the championship title at the end of this Adventure Path. Depending on your group and what you think you might like to do after this campaign, consider including descriptions of pre-written legendary artifacts like <em>shots of the First Vault</em>, a <em>deck of many things</em>, or an <em>orb of dragonkind</em>, all described in the <em>Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide</em>.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <em>Solar Jian </em>is a magical airship of exceptional make, with two parallel hulls and half a dozen wings, said to have been given flight by the spirits of two sacred birds called pengs. Although no one knows who built the original massive flying vehicle, it has spawned a few imitators, including the audaciously named <em>Solar Jian II</em>, built by the Goka-based Souran family and presented at the celebratory parade following each Ruby Phoenix Tournament for the past two centuries.</li>\n<li>Hao Jin’s personal <em>amulet of the planes </em>looks like a jade crescent moon on a chain of ruby beads. t is said to be flawless in accuracy, delivering the wielder unerringly to where they need to be (though not necessarily where they meant to go).</li>\n<li>• A clockwork “spell engine” retrieved from the Clicking Caverns under Nagajor has served Hao Jin in a few legendary battles. With enough calibration, the machine is supposedly capable of casting powerful spells all on its own.</li>\n<li>A Mahwek master bowyer from northern Arcadia supposedly crafted the <em>sky-piercing bow </em>(page 74) to summon rain in times of drought. The legendary longbow can split the sky and let its wielder travel as swiftly as an arrow. Hao Jin won it in a contest when she used a cantrip to split an arrow shot from the bow in midair.</li>\n<li>Hao Jin stole an indestructible shield called the <em>August Dilemma</em> from a centaur hero-god in Iblydos, though she failed to slay its villainous creator, who is hell-bent on reclaiming his relic.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2 Influence Rounds: </strong>The player characters have two chances to influence patrons during their visit to the Lantern Lodge. The first influence round takes place at the reception area, where everyone is enjoying food and drink while perusing the excerpts from the Pathfinder Chronicles. The characters have an hour to chat with any of the patrons; each character can make a single attempt to Influence a patron or Discover more information about a patron. They might comment about a particular historical item or ask any of the patrons about what they know of the history of Goka; the patrons are all excited to share their knowledge and expertise with visitors.</p>\n<p>The second influence round occurs halfway through the characters’ visit to the gallery, when Amara Li approaches both the characters’ team and Tino’s Toughest and asks them to step up to a small stage she has assembled in one corner of the gallery. Read or paraphrase the following aloud.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>Venture-Captain Amara Li bows and says, “Esteemed guests of the Pathfinder Society, Hao Jin, the Ruby Phoenix, I hope you have enjoyed our selections from the Pathfinder Chronicles. It is rare that we have an opportunity to meet adventurers as storied as yourselves. Before you leave today, I ask but one favor of you.” Li motions to the small stage and continues,  “If you enjoyed what you have read, I ask that you add your own stories to our records. Please, approach the stage and tell us whatever you like of your life. My chronicler Suen will carefully record the tales of your adventures for posterity. My co-hosts and I hope you will honor us with the choicest regalements before your departure.\"</p>\n</section>\n<p>During this second hour-long influence round, the characters have the undivided attention of Amara Li and the eight prospective patrons in attendance. Each character can take the stage in any order to tell a story from their past (including any notable events on Bonmu).</p>\n<p>Like a typical influence round, each player character can Influence or Discover, but this round is a little different in one important regard: a character’s check applies to all five potential patrons simultaneously. When a character tells a story, have the player roll a single Influence or Discover check, whichever they prefer. Compare the result of this check to each patron’s DC for that skill. If a character’s story obviously coincides with the likes or dislikes of any patrons, adjust the DC to Influence that patron or Discover information about that patron appropriately. The player characters can choose to forego this influence round at no penalty.</p>\n<p><strong>Amara Li’s Note: </strong>If the player characters impressed Amara Li with their tales of adventure, she gives the party a sealed thank-you note. Encrypted in the note’s text is information about each of the patrons. The player characters can deduce this hidden content in the note with a successful DC 20 Society or DC 30 Perception check; doing so grants the party one piece of information about each of the patrons as if the characters had succeeded at a skill check to Discover.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"XMtSKCIxhsCSKmUd":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.YuRymvRy2DsmqSx6"},"cf":{"id":"temp_t5vaum4jlmd"}}}

When the player characters arrive on the scene, they are just in time to witness the tail-end of fiercely emotional argument. The disagreement started when Unmar innocently asked Hida which team he was planning to bid on. When Hida mentioned the player characters’ team, Unmar muttered that “such a bold choice suits the general’s tastes,” and the discussion went downhill from there.</p>\n<p>Depending on the time of day, the characters and their patrons can either watch the sun set over the sea in the west, witness it rise over the Wall of Heaven to the east, or enjoy the midday ocean breeze and glittering waves under a blossoming (and pungent) gingko tree.</p>\n<p><strong>1 Influence Round:</strong> The player characters have just 15 minutes to Influence the patrons here or Discover more about their potential sponsors before other matters take precedence (see Creatures, below).

The ankous were summoned by Syndara the Sculptor to injure the player characters or, better yet, implicate them in the murder of these two potential patrons. Both ankous attempt to sneak up on the gathering, having bypassed Hida and Unmar’s guards just down the path. Hida and Unmar stay out of the fray— neither are as strong as they used to be, and they’ve no wish to be injured—but the ankous attack the old men viciously until reduced to half their Hit Points, at which point they divert their attention to the player characters.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Creatures</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.KIMySGGiT82hpBfc]{Elite Ankous (4)}</strong><strong>  </strong></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Clue:</strong> If captured, the ankous won’t respond to questioning, but if magically compelled to do so the ankous telepathically give the reason for their attack. A mysterious “outworlder” paid their fey liege on the First World a handsome sum for their services. They were to either injure the player characters to prevent them from competing or make it seem as though their team killed a high-ranking Gokan official. At this point, the ankous might display one of the platinum coins used to pay their liege, a currency no longer used in modern-day Golarion and that has an aura which registers faintly of conjuration magic. Beyond that, the ankous know nothing of who hired them.</p>\n<p>Even if the ankous are killed, the player characters should find the mysterious coin amid their remains— perhaps embedded in the back of a shadowy fist or in one of their eye sockets.</p>\n<p>The coin previously belonged to Syndara the Sculptor, who in turn received it from the Hwanggot despot who originally commissioned the demiplane called the Glass Lighthouse. In its 300 years in the Glass Lighthouse, the coin has inherited some of that plane’s magical energy, and its surface has become slightly warped with powerful conjuration magic.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Influence: </strong>If the player characters reduce the ankous to fewer than half their Hit Points within 2 rounds, they save Hida and Unmar from much of the fey assassins’ violence, and the party automatically gains 1 Influence Point with each patron. </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"XMtSKCIxhsCSKmUd":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.YuRymvRy2DsmqSx6"},"cf":{"id":"temp_t5vaum4jlmd"}}}

The competitors have all been instructed to meet here this morning to learn more about the Gokan sponsorship process and meet the eight patrons for this year’s teams. Alongside the heroes are the seven other qualifying teams, some of whom the player characters might not have seen since their adventures on Bonmu. Now is a good time for the player characters to catch up with any of the teams whom they made a connection with, such as Tino’s Toughest.</p>\n<p>The eight patrons soon arrive alongside Hao Jin, who is this year’s grand judge, and <strong>Archbanker Miang Malii</strong> (LN female Tian-Dtang banker 13), the highest-ranking priest of Abadar in the city and executor of Hao Jin’s estate. Read or paraphrase the following to set the scene.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>Ten figures stand in a lavish banquet hall within the Grand Bank of Abadar, all bathed in the amber light of the morning sun: the Ruby Phoenix Hao Jin in her eponymous crimson finery, a Tian-Dtang woman in white and gold silks worn by the clergy of Abadar, and eight well-dressed aristocrats. The cleric of Abadar clears her throat before addressing you and the other seven teams of fighters standing at the entrance of the grand room. Between the fighters and the hosts stands a long table covered in immaculately decorated and carefully arranged local food and tea.</p>\n<p>“Good morning, contenders. It is my honor to welcome you to Goka and congratulate you once more on successfully qualifying for the Ruby Phoenix Tournament.</p>\n<p>“But I will waste no more time with pleasantries. You are here, two weeks in advance of the start of the tournament, to familiarize yourself with the glorious city of Goka. I present to you this tournament’s eight patrons: business leaders and politicians hailing from the most prestigious quarters of Goka. These patrons will cover the substantial fees associated with entering and competing in the Ruby Phoenix Tournament, and perhaps more.</p>\n<p>“Throughout the coming week, you are invited to attend a variety of events at different locales where you will have the opportunity to meet with one or more of these patrons. During these gatherings, your potential patrons will identify the teams whose personalities and goals most align with their own interests. At the end of the week, each patron will make offers to sponsor the teams who have most impressed them. If you receive multiple offers, you will get to choose the sponsor whose offer or personality you find most appealing. Following this process is a final week of rest and relaxation before the start of the Ruby Phoenix Tournament.”</p>\n</section>\n<p>The archbanker introduces the eight patrons (summarized below) as well as the eight qualifying teams, then invites the patrons and the teams to acquaint themselves with one another for the next hour. She is also happy to answer any questions the player characters might have about the sponsorship process for the Ruby Phoenix Tournament or about the forthcoming events around Goka. Hao Jin, present purely as a formality, stays in the background and monitors the situation briefly before excusing herself.</p>\n<p><strong>Available Patrons:</strong> Of the tournament’s eight patrons, the player characters can hope to win the favor of only five; the other three patrons have already made up their minds about who they will sponsor, and they make this fact obvious very quickly. (To simplify things at the game table, you might explain to your players the meta-game reason for this restriction: the adventure is more streamlined with five potential patrons rather than eight.)</p>\n<p><strong>Unavailable Patrons:</strong> The following three sponsors have already decided which fighting team they will sponsor for the tournament, and so are not present for the influence encounters in this chapter.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lady Yen Tsing Jurai </strong>is the owner of the Red Dragon Casino on Goka’s Island of Endless Fortune; because she is also herself the gambling type, she decides right away to bid mightily to sponsor Tino’s Toughest, the obvious underdogs of the tournament.</li>\n<li><strong>Lord Buken Tegora</strong>, also known as the Spider of Goka, is a cold, calculating magnate who operates a generations-old private lending company who exploits the poor and hires unscrupulous mercenaries to collect overdue payments from them on a regular basis. He takes an immediate liking to the equally ruthless Lightkeepers and decides immediately to sponsor them.</li>\n<li><strong>Lady Narswani Vangarath </strong>has made a fortune in decades past selling replicas of famous weapons and armor used in the Ruby Phoenix Tournament. As a patron for this year’s tournament, she has her eyes set on sponsoring the Arms of Balance, whose weapons she believes will be ideal for manufacturing cheap replicas thanks to her family’s ties to the Vudran weapons market.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>1 Influence Round:</strong> The player characters have enough time during the meet-and-greet for 1 influence round.

The four teammates each trained at the Academy of Golden Arms in Indapatta, the capital of Vudra. There, they learned to tap into their elemental potential, which is said to exist within every warrior. As part of their final exam, the students were tasked with entering a notable tournament and achieving a commendable placement. The students petitioned Hao Jin to invite them to her upcoming Ruby Phoenix Tournament, which they explained would be an ideal means of concluding their tutelage. Moving past the pre-qualifying round into the tournament itself is more than suitable for their exam requirements, but the four have resolved to give the contest their all and go as far as possible in the competition.</p>\n<p>The Arms of Balance don’t have an appointed leader, though <strong>Ranya Shibhatesh</strong> (LN female human ki elementalist) was the first to suggest entry into the Ruby Phoenix Tournament. The team’s other fighters include <strong>Jivati Rovat </strong>(N female vishkanya ki elementalist), <strong>Pravan Majinapti </strong>(LG male human ki elementalist), and <strong>Usvani </strong>(LN male vanara ki elementalist). While they are all generally personable, the Arms of Balance project a stoic, focused, and altogether disquieting demeanor in combat.</p>\n<p> In the heat of battle, Ranya’s inscrutable face betrays little emotion as she manifests her connection to air in focused blasts of ki that surround her body and empower her fists and feet with electricity. Jivati fights with a pair of short swords wreathed in flame that create a mystifying spectacle as she dances around the battlefield, rarely opening her eyes as she does so. Pravan’s fluid movements emulate the grace both of the icy water he blasts at opponents and the waves he controls, and Usvani maintains a state of loud, steady breathing while enveloping his body with sand and stone, becoming nigh immovable and unbreakable. The four often combine their powers to summon chunks of hot magma or blasts of burning steam to overwhelm their opponents.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Each competitor on this team of elementalists has a unique special ability that only they can use; a fighter’s ability is denoted by the individual’s name in the traits parenthetical in the stat block below. Only that individual can use the ability (so, for instance, the Arms of Balance can’t use Breath of the Volcano four times per round, since only Usvani knows that ability). Each fighter has a different rune on their <em>handwraps of mighty blows</em>, allowing each to deal a different type of energy damage with their fist Strikes.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>OPPONENTS</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.74HIX2Uaf1GvbIk6]{Jivati Rovat}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.OWYZxMyUd6VHnlHX]{Pravan Majinapti}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.GDpdYLGdEAyjygGf]{Ranya Shibhatesh}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.8zBr3gLP6m43X4dy]{Usvani}</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"XMtSKCIxhsCSKmUd":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.YuRymvRy2DsmqSx6"},"cf":{"id":"temp_eb82vavtgfc"}}}

The group came together when its leaders, <strong>Amihan </strong>and <strong>Maalya  </strong>(N female human battle dancers), set out from their home, the island of Mandurai in northern Minata. The sisters are on a traditional coming-of-age quest, in which they must find a piece of another culture to bring home to share with their people. During their journey, the sisters encountered <strong>Halspin the Stung </strong>(NG male catfolk beast singer) and <strong>Joon-Seo </strong>(LN male samsaran song striker), whom they grew close to and invited to join their fighting team.</p>\n<p>The sisters are practitioners of battle dancing, a martial art that emphasizes constant motion, which made its way from western Garund to Minata in previous centuries. In combat, Amihan and Maalya use their constant movement to make themselves difficult targets and mislead opponents into creating openings. The sisters have honed their battle dancing techniques to work better together. During a fight, the sisters move in a hypnotic, tandem step that is both beautiful and deadly, working together to outmaneuver a foe.</p>\n<p>Amihan and Maalya dance to the songs of Halspin the Stung. The catfolk uses his morin khurr to produce haunting melodies that inspire his allies, a technique he perfected in the dangerous Valashmai Jungle. After a doomed encounter with Ebeshra the Winged Razor left him bedridden for months, Halspin believed himself to be unable to ever fight again. He eventually found inspiration again when he met Amihan and Maalya. He joined the sisters in their travels with the hope of proving himself a capable warrior once more.</p>\n<p> Joon-Seo, also a virtuoso, uses his voice as a weapon. He can focus his singing into powerful blasts of sonic force capable of knocking opponents off their feet. Joon-Seo claims that this power is a result of every one of his previous lives singing within him, empowering each note. While he knows little of his past lives, Joon-Seo believes himself to have entered the Ruby Phoenix Tournament once before, and he joined the Steps of the Sun in an attempt to better understand this particular past life.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>OPPONENTS</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.nHftZQGyzlZdQYjj]{Amihan}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.mlquof7FsoDaN9W2]{Maalya}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.SQ8T2QZVFcjLQ89g]{Halspin the Stung}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.o47dOaBtrWABU5z3]{Joon-seo}</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"XMtSKCIxhsCSKmUd":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.YuRymvRy2DsmqSx6"},"cf":{"id":"temp_eb82vavtgfc"}}}

The bard is performing at one of Goka’s oldest theaters, the Empress Yin Opera House, and will be practicing his set every evening, so the player characters have a chance to see him any day they show up. Whenever the player characters arrive at the opera house, the Steps of the Sun and the Lightkeepers are also present. The potential patrons in attendance are General Kaso Hida, Lady Qiu May Shai, and Lady Xhai Zhia.</p>\n<p>The opera house (shown in the map on page 16) features a wide L-shaped stage set before an array of seats, a long table on the main floor, and exclusive balcony seating for those with ample money to spend. The fighting teams, prospective patrons, and Razu’s personnel are the only ones in attendance during the dress rehearsal. Onstage, Razu is accompanied by his two elemental assistants, called melodies on the wind, who provide sound effects and illusions of other voices and instruments. </p>\n<p><strong>1 Influence Round: </strong>The player characters have about half an hour (1 round) to chat with the patrons in attendance over dinner before the dress rehearsal starts. Lady Zhia roped General Hida into attending the rehearsal, but the mercenary is more interested in the snacks and tea than the music. Zhia and Shai, on the other hand, are very much interested in the show, as well as Goka’s music scene in general.</p>\n<p><strong>Hazard: </strong>In the middle of Razu’s engaging performance, his melodies on the wind ripple with excitement just before a magical rift forms in the middle of the stage (use the map on page 16 to run this encounter). The portal leads to the Plane of Air and causes the elemental magic of that plane to seep onto the Material Plane. At first, a sudden rush of wind is the only apparent effect of this bright blue rift, but the portal’s dangers quickly become apparent when a blast of wind knocks a prop ship onto a stagehand and sprays shrapnel over the audience, including the player characters. At this point, roll initiative. During the ensuing catastrophe, the Steps of the Sun rush to the back of the stage to help evacuate Razu’s personnel, but the Lightkeepers merely stand to the side and look about helplessly. If something isn’t done soon, the patrons in attendance could be in imminent danger.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Hazards</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.wbsyKHXTlKCEw7TJ]{Air Rift}</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Terrain: </strong>The tables provide partial cover and are difficult terrain to walk over. The stage is 3 feet off the floor, generally requiring a Leap to get up to. The balcony level is 20 feet above the main floor.</p>\n<p><strong>Magical Catastrophe:</strong> The strange phenomenon is a result of the interplay of elemental music here, the remnants of Syndara the Sculptor’s interplanar magic affecting the Lightkeepers, and Hao Jin’s own incredible ambient aura. The source is not immediately clear, and the incredible surge in magical energy makes it impossible to precisely pinpoint the cause.

Anyone who is trained in Vampire Lore or an expert in Goka Lore, however, knows that the process to become a jiang-shi is no mean feat, and few would willfully die in order to achieve such power—especially just to exact a single instance of petty revenge. A character who succeeds at a DC 37 Perception check while talking with the jiang-shi can deduce this fact. If pressed for more details or affected by an ability such as a <em>zone of truth </em>spell, the jiang-shi reveal that they each have alarming gaps in their memory. The last thing any of the vampires remembers is riding in the same boat back to Goka with a team called the Lightkeepers. The two teams got to drinking some strong wine, and the jiang-shi remember feeling quite ill, but that’s the last thing they can recall with any certainty.</p>\n<p>In fact, the Lightkeepers lethally poisoned their boatmates before transporting their bodies back to Syndara’s extraplanar realm, the Glass Lighthouse. There, Syndara took his time researching foul texts and enacting equally evil rituals to transform the fighters into undead minions, further brainwashing them into hating the player characters’ team and then scrubbing their memories of his meddling. The players obviously have no way to piece this all together yet, but by the end of the tournament they’ll have a good idea that the Lightkeepers are far from benign opponents.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"XMtSKCIxhsCSKmUd":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.YuRymvRy2DsmqSx6"},"cf":{"id":"temp_lhqqz4oyaj"}}}

Their unique fighting styles make it difficult for opponents to anticipate their movements, which indeed resemble those of the possessed. The leader of the group, <strong>Yarrika Mulandez </strong>(LG female human spiritualist) has a strange bond with a phantom that fights alongside her in combat. Yarrika believes the phantom to be the soul of her grandfather, who was her original combat teacher, but whether or not this is true is unverifiable; the phantom manifests as a silent, humanoid figure with the head and arms of a mantis. Regardless, Yarrika and her phantom work in tandem to pummel opponents, acting as if they’ve been lifelong partners. Yarrika’s connections also allow her to speak with other spirits; while traveling, she occasionally offers her services as a spirit medium.</p>\n<p>Yarrika’s two teammates are <strong>Artus Rodrivan</strong> (LN male half-elf soul archer) and <strong>Lantondo </strong>(LN wyrwood harrower). Artus fires arrows formed from the spiritual energy of his own soul, and so he must be careful when fighting to avoid causing irreparable damage to his immortal spirit. The arrows themselves appear to be made of pure colorless light. Incredibly, Artus can alter the trajectory of his arrows mid-flight, allowing him to redirect a wayward shot to circle back on a missed target and strike them from behind. Lantondo’s weapon of choice is a harrow deck made from thin sheets of wood. The deck was crafted from the same wood as Lantondo. Although they’re silent on the matter, rumor has it that each card has a miniature heart, similar to that of a wyrwood, which allows Lantondo to control the cards as if they were an extension of the harrower’s own body. In combat, Lantondo flings harrow cards with blinding speed to cut down opponents from a distance. Lantondo can use their connection to the deck to recall thrown cards, effectively granting them limitless ammunition. Before every fight, the Biting Roses gather together so that Lantondo can perform a harrow reading for the group, using what they learn from this reading to plan battle strategies and gain insight into the abilities of their opponents.</p>\n<p>The Biting Roses have entered the Ruby Phoenix Tournament hoping to acquire a fortune they can bring back to their impoverished hometown.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>OPPONENTS</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.bWvlZnaoc1PqMoyN]{Yarrika Mulandez}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.CticaJ2fRTnNH2mJ]{Grandfather Mantis}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.HbC8VqLO4DgMwAFr]{Artus Rodrivan}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.hejKQG4e495oxl8L]{Lantondo}</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"XMtSKCIxhsCSKmUd":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.YuRymvRy2DsmqSx6"},"cf":{"id":"temp_eb82vavtgfc"}}}

Having recently completed their Perquisite—a period of public service required to move beyond the level of initiate—the students were invited to the Ruby Phoenix Tournament as de facto representatives of their historied school. The Speakers to the Winds believe that if they succeed in the tournament, they could use their newfound fame to bring even greater attention to the Magaambya and use their winnings to sponsor promising new students from Tian Xia and beyond.</p>\n<p>The team fights under the supervision of Professor <strong>Mafika Ayuwari </strong>(NG male Zenj Tempest-Sun halcyon speaker), a young faculty member of the Magaambya’s Tempest-Sun branch and the team’s leader. His students include <strong>Akila Stormheel </strong>(LN female halfling Emerald Boughs attendant), <strong>Boundless Hummingbird </strong>and <strong>Phuthi Nuware </strong>(N female gnoll Cascade Bearer transmuters), <strong>Surjit Hamelan </strong>(LN male gnome Rain-Scribe attendant), and <strong>Umbasi </strong>(N pangender elf Uzunjati attendant). Each of the students is a member of one of the Magaambya’s five branches and has a different magical focus. Though their instruction varied greatly, the five all began their studies at the Magaambya at the same time and have grown particularly close. Their shared inquisitive spirit and close bond enable the Speakers to the Winds to instantaneously read and understand each other’s movements. Their coordinated improvisation means that the students rarely repeat strategies or moves, making it nearly impossible for rivals to accurately anticipate their tactics—though the students all have their own unconscious tells, such as the sudden arching of an eyebrow or a nearly imperceptible nod of the head.</p>\n<p>The distinctive magical training of each Speaker becomes particularly apparent in combat. Akila calls upon the power of her mask, which holds her spirit face, to take on aspects of the leopard and strike with great speed and power. Boundless Hummingbird uses her magic to empower her allies and transform herself into a devastating being of pure wind, while Phuthi’s protective magic defends and restores her allies, allowing them to continue fighting in combat for much longer. Surjit uses his connection to natural magic to camouflage himself and ambush his foes with surprise attacks. Umbasi calls upon the tales and songs of their Ekujae ancestors to inspire their companions. Finally, Mafika is perhaps the most straightforward fighter of all, using a powerful combination of arcane and primal effects to obliterate opponents and protect his students.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Opponents</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.ji6TV3NCTHChCYA7]{Mafika Ayuwari}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.ZTX6JMUhY9E761Af]{Akila Stormheel}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.LJYzgFuQYsQq9Uag]{Boundless Hummingbird}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.4GKs2icX5cgmwype]{Phuthi Nuware}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.xfUhN4goPlhDoU3v]{Surjit Hamelan}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-actor.0edXaiayOAJkBdC4]{Umbasi}</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"XMtSKCIxhsCSKmUd":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.YuRymvRy2DsmqSx6"},"cf":{"id":"temp_eb82vavtgfc"}}}

The tournament also features a number of special events. The following terms are commonly used throughout this chapter.</p>\n<p><strong>Tournament matches </strong>are the big events of the Ruby Phoenix Tournament—the fights that ultimately determine the competition’s champion team. Each tournament match takes place on the flat main arena (use the Grand Arena: Base Form map on page 24) of the Cliffside Court. Any matches in the winners’ bracket or losers’ bracket are tournament matches.</p>\n<p><strong>Exhibition matches </strong>are special showcase fights designed to titillate the crowd and fill the lulls between tournament matches. Exhibition matches have no effect on any team’s standing in the tournament, but still award prizes of gold and items, making it worth each team’s while to give their all during such matches.</p>\n<p>Tournament and exhibition matches might also be called “bouts,” which is a catch-all term that describes any Ruby Phoenix Tournament fighting event. Although the brackets and the tournament matches are publicly posted, the nature of each exhibition match is a secret until the start of the event.</p>\n<p>The main tournament bracket is called the <strong>winners’ bracket</strong>. All eight teams begin the tournament in this bracket. The losing teams from these matches are moved to the <strong>losers’ bracket</strong>, where they compete against subsequent losing teams in a separate, smaller tournament. The winner of the losers’ bracket gets to move on to the final round of the tournament to compete against the winner of the winners’ bracket. (Essentially this means that a team must lose two matches in order to be disqualified from the tournament.) All bouts in either the winners’ or the losers’ brackets are tournament matches.</p>\n<p>The following diagram shows the lineup for the first four matches of the tournament, which are public knowledge. The diagram also shows the outcomes of fights that don’t involve the player characters’ team, which are scripted in this adventure’s text for convenience, but these outcomes are obviously unknown to the participants and spectators of the Ruby Phoenix Tournament until the match is completed.</p>\n<p>As written in this adventure, during the first round of the winners’ bracket, the Speakers to the Winds defeat the Biting Roses, the Steps of the Sun defeat the Arms of Balance, and the Lightkeepers defeat Tino’s Toughest. In the second match of the second round of the winners’ bracket, the Lightkeepers defeat the Steps of the Sun. In the losers’ bracket, Tino’s Toughest is scripted to defeat the Arms of Balance in the second match of the first round of the losers’ bracket.</p>\n<p>The blank slots in the brackets signify matches where one or more of the participants depends on how the player characters do in their bouts. For example, in the first match of the first round of the losers’ bracket, the Biting Roses face either the player characters or Winter’s Roar, whichever team lost the first bout in the winners’ bracket.</p>\n<p>Assuming the player characters don’t lose two matches during the tournament, then no matter how exactly they fare in the winners’ bracket they should still be able to fight each team at least once and should still be able to take part in all the exhibitions (even if this means they take part in an exhibition and a tournament match in the same day). The text underneath each day describes the possible contingencies for if the player characters win or lose any of the fights in the winners’ bracket. For potential ways to keep the adventure on track if the characters lose a fight in the losers’ bracket, see the What if They Lose? sidebar on page 3.</p>\n<p>Prizes: For each exhibition match or tournament match, each team earns a set prize in gold, win or lose. The winning team also gets a magic item. These prizes are noted in the Prize entry at the end of each match.</p>\n<p><strong>XP Awards:</strong> Regardless of whether or not the player characters win a fight, award them the full experience points for each match. Because it is impossible to predict which team the player characters will fight in most cases, the threat category for each encounter has been omitted from its usual place in the headlines for these encounters, meaning you will have to calculate the party’s XP award yourself.</p>\n<p>The player characters are likely to reach 1,000 XP before the end of this chapter. To keep the matches as challenging as intended, you can either wait to allow the party to level up until after their final fight against the Lightkeepers on Day 8, or else you can allow the party to level up and then adjust the statistics of each of their remaining opponents by using the elite adjustments from page 6 of the Pathfinder Bestiary. Because the player characters often have just one or two bouts per day and can thus expend all their resources without worrying about conserving spells or other abilities, each bout is a significant challenge, typically severe or extreme.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>SUBPAGES</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-journal-entry.qr1DZhlPbdMUM77e]{Tournament Rules}</li>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-journal-entry.qFZKwUSR9oPQKSBa]{PCs in the Audience}</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"XMtSKCIxhsCSKmUd":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.YuRymvRy2DsmqSx6"},"cf":{"id":"temp_2hd01hp5hpp"}}}

{"_id":"zqArRBoJomDI9Ch9","name":"Exploring Goka","content":"<blockquote style=\"padding-left:var(--space-2xl);width:643.891px\">\n<h4 style=\"font-family:var(--sans-serif)\">BACKLINK</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-journal-entry.39NQqQixC4RNCcKD]{Chapter 1: In Search of Sponsorship}</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The player characters can explore Goka however they like in the week leading up to the Ruby Phoenix Tournament. They should have already received enough downtime during their journey to Goka to Retrain or Craft, but at your discretion the party might reach Goka early enough to do these things in the city rather than during their trip. The locations detailed on the following pages all feature an opportunity to Influence one or more patrons using the influence subsystem (as described above). Each location lists how many influence rounds take place at that location (1 or 2), which patrons are at that location, and any special considerations for the influence round(s). Note that the listed influence rounds should occur at each location only once; multiple visits to the same location should not garner the player characters additional influence rounds. Aside from the Grand Bank of Abadar, which is where the party starts the adventure, these locations can be visited in any order.</p>\n<p>The party is free to explore other parts of Goka as well. Refer to the map on the inside front cover and the Goka article starting on page 60 for more details about this city.</p>\n<p> This adventure also includes random events (see Events Around Goka on page 20) that can take place anywhere in Goka during the lead-up to the Ruby Phoenix Tournament. Once the characters have passed 7 days exploring the city, proceed to the Exhibition Showcase on page 24.</p>\n<p><strong>Gathering Information: </strong>Outside of influence rounds, the players might choose to spend time learning about their potential patrons by Gathering Information either with the Diplomacy skill as normal or with other skills if they can devise creative justifications. For example, a fighter might use Athletics to Gather Information by using her incredible strength to impress some royal guards, who in turn divulge an interesting rumor about one or more potential patrons.</p>\n<p>In addition to learning about potential patrons, the characters can also use this time to study their competition. By succeeding at a DC 35 check to Gather Information, a character can learn the general background of any of their opponents as detailed in the “Ruby Phoenix Fighting Roster” article on page 66 of the previous adventure. The exception to this is the Lightkeepers, who are the primary antagonists of the Adventure Path and secretly serve the cruel demiplane crafter Syndara the Sculptor. If the player characters try to find out more about the Lightkeepers, they can learn the general backgrounds of each of the fighters on that team as well as the fact that some of their incredible powers seem to come from beyond the Material Plane. If a character critically succeeds on their check to Gather Information about the Lightkeepers, they learn that the Lightkeepers have whispered the name “Syndara” to one another on various occasions, though the implications of this mysterious benefactor should remain unclear. (Because Hao Jin has lost most memories of Syndara, mentioning this name to her means nothing for the time being.)</p>\n<p>At any rate, to avoid making acquiring knowledge about their potential patrons and their adversaries too easy, each player character should only be given one chance per day to Gather Information.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>SUBPAGES</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-2-journal-entry.jlFiwyA19CdZASjN]{A1.
