For example, <em>+1 striking handwraps of mighty blows</em> would give you a +1 item bonus to attack rolls with your unarmed attacks and increase the damage of your unarmed attacks from one weapon die to two (normally 2d4 instead of 1d4, but if your fists have a different weapon damage die or you have other unarmed attacks, use two of that die size instead).</p>\n<p>You can upgrade, add, and transfer runes to and from the handwraps just as you would for a weapon, and you can attach talismans to the handwraps. Treat the handwraps as melee weapons of the brawling group with light Bulk for these purposes. Property runes apply only when they would be applicable to the unarmed attack you're using. For example, a property that must be applied to a slashing weapon wouldn't function when you attacked with a fist, but you would gain its benefits if you attacked with a claw or some other slashing unarmed attack.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"traits":{"value":["agile","finesse","invested","magical","nonlethal","transmutation","unarmed"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"handwraps-of-mighty-blows","schema":{"version":0.743,"lastMigration":null},"quantity":1,"baseItem":null,"hp":{"brokenThreshold":0,"value":0,"max":0},"hardness":0,"weight":{"value":"-"},"equippedBulk":{"value":""},"price":{"value":"35 gp"},"equipped":{"carryType":"worn","invested":null,"handsHeld":0,"inSlot":false},"stackGroup":null,"negateBulk":{"value":"0"},"containerId":null,"preciousMaterial":{"value":null},"preciousMaterialGrade":{"value":null},"size":"med","identification":{"status":"identified","unidentified":{"name":"","img":"","data":{"description":{"value":""}}},"misidentified":{}},"usage":{"value":"worngloves"},"level":{"value":2},"category":"unarmed","group":"brawling","bonus":{"value":1},"damage":{"value":"","dice":1,"die":"d4","damageType":"bludgeoning"},"bonusDamage":{"value":0},"splashDamage":{"value":null},"range":null,"reload":{"value":""},"MAP":{"value":""},"potencyRune":{"value":2},"strikingRune":{"value":"greaterStriking"},"specific":{"value":false},"propertyRune1":{"value":"greaterCorrosive"},"propertyRune2":{"value":null},"propertyRune3":{"value":null},"propertyRune4":{"value":null},"property1":{"value":"","dice":null,"die":"","damageType":"","critDice":null,"critDie":"","critDamage":"","critDamageType":"","criticalConditionType":"","criticalConditionValue":null,"strikeConditionType":"","strikeConditionValue":null}},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.FNDq4NFSN0g2HKWO"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/equipment/worn-items/other-worn-items/handwraps-of-mighty-blows.webp","name":"+2 Gerater Striking Greater Corrosive Handwraps of Mighty Blows","sort":500000,"type":"weapon","effects":[],"folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"ARV7fyOKOhXKGuJe","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>These stiff leather armguards grant you a +2 item bonus to AC and saving throws, and a maximum Dexterity modifier of +5.

Not all are adored, for plenty of these creatures act wickedly.</p>\n<p>DRACONIC CYCLES</p>\n<p>Five elements underpin the magical powers of imperial dragons, influencing their relationships to all things and, especially, to others of their kind. These elements interlink in two cycles. In the first cycle, each element feeds one other: wood feeds fire, fire feeds earth, earth feeds metal, metal feeds water, and water feeds wood. In the second cycle, each element counters another: wood counters earth, earth counters water, water counters fire, fire counters metal, and metal counters wood.</p>\n<p>Each imperial dragon represents one element and has four abilities related to the cycle. For example, the forest dragon-linked to wood-feeds fire, is fed by water, counters earth, and is countered by metal.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Underworld dragons embody the pressure between tectonic plates, the heat behind geysers, and flash fires that ignite when the conditions are just right. Natural alchemists, they innately understand reagents and catalysts.
