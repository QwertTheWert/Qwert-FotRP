A sandy area in the center of the atrium surrounds a pond full of dark, dirty water. From the center of the pond rises a small stone structure with a wide, flat top. Large, open doorways lead to the north, south, east, and west.</p>\n</section>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The monks used this pond for meditation by sitting upon the wide top of the stone structure, which is strong enough to support an adult’s weight. Sitting here offered the additional benefit of hiding the meditator’s reflection, which made it easier to disconnect from one’s self during their practice. The structure is also infused with minor magic that constantly purifies the pond water, though it’s not strong enough to hide or deter the pond’s current inhabitant.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creature: </strong>A powerful catoblepas broke into the temple a few weeks ago after preparations for the Ruby Phoenix Tournament drove it from its home in the nearby forest. The monster found an open wall at the eastern end of the temple (<strong>A13</strong>) and eventually made its way to the pond here. Now, it splits its time between the pond, where it rests, and the forest, where it hunts for food. It continues to use the same broken wall as an entrance, preventing all of Ahmitar’s attempts to repair the barrier. For the moment, the catoblepas and Ahmitar share a silent understanding, allowing the anugobu to move through this room as long as he doesn’t disturb the monster.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Since the catoblepas isn’t always here, there’s a possibility that the room is empty the first time the player characters move through it. During the day, there is a 50% chance the monster is out hunting. It eventually returns to the pond at sunset, where it remains until morning. If the catoblepas is here when the characters enter, it brays a loud warning before attacking anyone who remains in the room or tries to continue further. The catoblepas chases intruders out of the temple before returning to the pond, though if reduced to fewer than 50 Hit Points, it flees into the forest for its life.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Elite Catoblepas</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Hazard: </strong>The catoblepas’s presence here slowly turned the pond into a noxious pool of tainted water.

The Taumatans used their great knowledge in the arcane arts and engineering to maintain an empire spanning thousands of miles. During the Earthfall disaster, great floods, storms, and tsunamis wiped out Taumata, an event that most Minatan folklore assigns to vengeful gods angered by the country’s blasphemy. Most of Taumata was lost, with only a handful of structures and relics surviving the cataclysm. The land itself shattered into countless islands that constitute the archipelago now called Minata. Among this vast archipelago lies the small island of Bonmu, once the location of one of Taumata’s capital cities and featuring one of the most complete collections of ancient Taumatan architecture and artifacts.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Several millennia after the Taumatan empire’s destruction, a large number of Tian-Sings discovered Bonmu and took residence among the abandoned structures. They made the island a center of religious worship, repurposing many of the temples to forgotten Taumatan gods into temples of Tian-Sing deities like Gozreh, Hei Feng, and Irori. The new Bonmuans enjoyed peace and prosperity for decades.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This peace met an abrupt end in 4606 AR. A massive tsunami struck the western Arcadian coast and pulled much of the ocean away, creating temporary land bridges between Minata’s islands that lasted for days. Terrifying creatures from the nearby Valashmai Jungle—including Mogaru, a massive saurian kaiju—used these new bridges to make their way to the Minatan isles, including Bonmu. The Bonmuans watched in horror as Mogaru rampaged across neighboring islands and smaller monstrosities overran their home. They ultimately fled to avoid obliteration and never looked back, believing the again -abandoned island to be cursed. Since that time, Bonmu has had an ill reputation, though most pragmatists—including Hao Jin and her fellow tournament organizers—disregard these rumors as nothing more than superstition.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">As Hao Jin began implementing her changes to the Ruby Phoenix Tournament, she chose Bonmu as the site for her qualifying round. She was already familiar with the island and the empire of Taumata and recognized dangerous wilderness as a fitting place to test her chosen contestants. In Hao Jin’s mind, Bonmu’s dangerous reputation only adds to the tournament’s air of mystique, but she also knew the addition of a playful monicker—“Danger Island”— couldn’t hurt.</p>","img":"","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wgjTDLixUZ8YXqS9":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"},"cf":{"id":"temp_0qowe1ymurfh","color":"#000000"}}}

Renowned for her interplanar travels and phoenix-like powers of self-resurrection— the source of her sobriquet—perhaps the only thing that can rival Hao Jin’s fame is her vast collection of relics and artifacts. She accumulated these treasures over centuries in honor of her deity Abadar’s reliquary of wonders, the First Vault. Her ultimate goal in seeking such treasures was to achieve true immortality, but this destiny ever eludes her.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">When Hao Jin finally resigned herself to the fact that she would someday die, she set about devising contingencies to prevent her priceless relics from disappearing into the annals of history upon her death. She left the Gokan Temple of Abadar detailed instructions for how to handle her estate in the event of her disappearance. Such a contingency came to pass in 6891 ic (Imperial Calendar; 4391 ar), when Hao Jin failed to appear at the temple as she had said she would. The Abadarans could only presume her dead and, in keeping with Hao Jin’s wishes, organized the first Ruby Phoenix Tournament—a grand fighting spectacle that would draw athletes from around the world. Every 10 years, the winner of this glorious competition gets to claim one item from Hao Jin’s magnificent vault as their prize. In this way, many of her relics were released back into the world, one by one, for over 300 years.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\">Chapter 1 Synopsis</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The player characters arrive on the remote island of Bonmu in the island nation of Minata, where they will compete against other fighters from around the world to qualify for the Ruby Phoenix Tournament. First, the characters must locate the abandoned temple of Irori designated as their headquarters for the duration of the three-day qualifying round. As they make their way through the temple, the characters quickly learn they aren’t the only denizens—they’ll need to clear out the various creatures and threats, including roaming beasts and restless undead, before they can call it home. Once the temple is clear, the characters get the rest of the day to prepare as they wish in anticipation for the start of the qualifying round the next morning.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\">Language in Tian Xia</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Tian Xia is a region home to a diverse array of peoples, each with their own languages. The most broadly spoken language in the region is Tien, which functions as a common tongue in the same way Taldane does in the Inner Sea region. Since the NPCs of this Adventure Path hail from across the globe, their statistics list the proper name of the language they speak, rather than Common. Creatures in the Adventure Toolbox, since they can be adapted for any game, still use Common to refer to the most prevalent language in the region where they appear.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">For more information on the people of Tian Xia, see the <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Character Guide</em>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-1.8ZyDHPbUSBzS8b7K]{The Vengeful Axiomite}</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-1.nKSPGoVO5jv4prXQ]{The Ruby Phoenix Tournament}</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-1.3nwPHANHpUIw1chu]{Bonmu}</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-1.LZ9gBAXU6uDgRKtj]{Getting Started}</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-1.tkZammVVCVNyF21E]{Setting Out}</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-1.OBUTfvNBm3p4yb13]{Temple of Irori}</li>\n</ul>","img":null,"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wgjTDLixUZ8YXqS9":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"}}}

Shrine","content":"<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-1.OBUTfvNBm3p4yb13]{Temple of Irori}</li>\n</ul>\n<section class=\"readaloud\">\n<p>Tarnished bells, frayed ribbons, and crumbling wooden beams surround the massive statue at the center of this shrine space, which is set into an alcove at the eastern side of the temple’s open-air training area. Six steps lead up to a clearing where one can sit before the large statue, which depicts a smiling old man seated in a cross-legged position and holding a staff. A pair of braziers stand on either side of the steps and various prayer instruments lie scattered before the statue. The alcove’s northern wall is badly damaged, with a fifteen-foot-wide gap that reveals the forest outside the temple.</p>\n</section>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The monks used this shrine to lead prayer for the entire temple. Rather than attempt the futile endeavor of creating a depiction of Irori for the shrine, the monks carved a statue of the Old Man, Irori’s herald.[</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creature: </strong>The statue of the Old Man was originally an ordinary statue, but when the Broken Rebus began their attack on the temple, the defending monks’ cries reached Irori, who infused the statue with power and caused it to become a divine warden. The statue rose from this shrine and joined the temple monks in fending off the Broken Rebus. While it defeated the remaining Broken Rebus rebels, the divine warden could not save the loyal temple monks. Once the attack was over, the statue returned to the shrine, where it has remained ever since.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The statue of the Old Man remains infused with Irori’s power and still defends the temple to the best of its abilities. The haunts and spirits within the temple remain contained with their respective areas, and for reasons unknown, the divine warden has spared the catoblepas in area A7. The emissary’s agents, knowing of the warden’s might, decided the shrine would be the perfect place to hide the team’s phoenix necklace. If a character tries to take the necklace or any of the other treasures on the shrine, the statue springs to life and attempts to reclaim the temple’s relics. Returning the items causes the statue to end its attack.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Once in combat, the statue makes a brutal foe, using its staff to strike at distant opponents and grabbing anyone who gets too close. It uses its domain spells to clear away any conditions, saving its enduring might spell to reduce damage from a critical hit. The statue fights until it is destroyed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Whether or not they realize it, the player characters have several means of pacifying the statue. If every character wears a religious symbol of Irori, the statue immediately stops its assault, recognizing the characters as Irori’s faithful. A character who succeeds at a DC 25 Religion check to Recall Knowledge recognizes that the statue is a divine warden. A character armed with that knowledge can attempt a DC 30 Religion or DC 25 Irori Lore check to Recall Knowledge; on a success, they recall a prayer koan about the Old Man. If a character speaks this prayer, which requires spending three actions to utter in its entirety, the statue recognizes that character as Irori’s faithful as well, and it doesn’t attack that character further. In addition, the statue becomes clumsy 1 and enfeebled 1. These conditions increase by 1 for each additional character that utters the prayer. If all the characters speak the prayer, the statue stops its attack and loses its conditions, returning to rest at the shrine.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Old Man Statue</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Treasure: </strong>During his time repairing the temple of Irori, Ahmitar collected the loose gold and treasures scattered around the temple and placed them here before the statue. In addition to the <em>phoenix necklace </em>(page 75), Ahmitar has left here a <em>bag of holding type III</em>, a <em>jade serpent wondrous figurine</em>, a <em>phylactery of faithfulness of Irori</em>, a <em>ring of swimming</em>, and 570 gp in assorted gems and coins.</p>","img":"","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wgjTDLixUZ8YXqS9":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"},"cf":{"id":"temp_ksy3ykjj0tf","color":"#000000"}}}

Within this demiplane, Hao Jin stored entire monuments, cities, and even landscapes taken from the Material Plane— as well as the people who dwelled in these captured locales. Her reasons for collecting these locations and inhabitants were mixed. Some settlements were in imminent danger of besiegement, pestilence, or other certain doom, and Hao Jin sought to preserve the areas and their people by shielding them inside her magical domain. Other locales simply struck her as so beautiful that she had to have them in her collection.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">By the time of her disappearance, Hao Jin had amassed a sizable collection of geographic keepsakes and sentient beings within her powerful artifact. In her absence, the <em>Hao Jin Tapestry</em> collected dust in the back of Hao Jin’s vault in Goka. When contestants began fighting in the Ruby Phoenix Tournament for her treasures, it was only a matter of time before a winner chose the Hao Jin Tapestry as their prize and, wittingly or not, released its trapped denizens back into the cosmos.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This came to pass in 4711 ar, when agents of the Pathfinder Society won that decade’s tournament and claimed the tapestry. After studying the relic and gleaning its true powers, formidable Pathfinders undid the magic of the fabric and relinquished the encaged locations back into the world. For the most part, this was a welcome occurrence—the dangers that threatened the subsumed communities and monuments had long vanished in the centuries since Hao Jin preserved them, and now the descendants of the people originally trapped within could immigrate to the Material Plane and go about their lives in the wider world. For some, however, dwelling in <em>Hao Jin’s Tapestry</em> was worse than a prison—for them, it was nothing short of a personal hell.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Such was the case for an axiomite (Pathfinder Bestiary 9) known as Syndara the Sculptor, a fellow builder of demiplanes who befriended Hao Jin during her extraplanar adventures long ago. The two originally shared a friendly rivalry and fostered many qualities and interests in one another, including the manipulation of planar energies and the study of physical fitness through martial arts. Unlike Hao Jin, Syndara was more mercenary with his talents; he hired out his demiplane-building services to anyone with the coin to pay, specializing in the construction of personal pleasure playgrounds and extradimensional museum galleries. When Syndara constructed a demiplane for a wicked aristocrat named Sok Jyun-son—a Tian-Hwan despot who had strong-armed considerable land from Hwanggot natives during that nation’s time under imperial Lung Wa’s thumb—Hao Jin couldn’t bear the thought of her friend aiding one who had committed so many atrocities so close to her own homeland. The Ruby Phoenix placed Sok Jyun-son and his domain of terror into the Hao Jin Tapestry, alongside the treacherous Syndara and his current work-in-progress: a demiplane encased in a crystal bauble that the Sculptor affectionately called the Glass Lighthouse. Sok Jyun-son eventually perished within the Hao Jin Tapestry, but Syndara, immortal by his very nature, did not.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Time is a fickle construct in demiplanes. While it generally moves at the same pace as the Material Plane, at other times it follows its own rules. Within the Glass Lighthouse, trapped inside the Hao Jin Tapestry, time warped and stretched, expanding the 300 years between Hao Jin’s imprisonment of Syndara and his return to the Material Plane over a thousand times. Sealed away in that tiny cell with no one but himself for company, 300,000 years was more than enough for Syndara to become incredibly powerful— and obsessed with revenge. For her part, Hao Jin forgot Syndara when she willingly gave up her knowledge of the Hao Jin Tapestry’s creation in penance to extradimensional beings who persecuted her for her hubris.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Now, released from imprisonment after so long, Syndara has dedicated the rest of his existence to hunting down and destroying Hao Jin.</p>","img":"","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wgjTDLixUZ8YXqS9":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"},"cf":{"id":"temp_0qowe1ymurfh","color":"#000000"}}}

An old skeleton lies slumped against the base of the tree, bones spotted with fallen peels of multicolored bark. Amid the bark scraps lies a single silver feather. A hallway to the north serves as entrance and exit from the chamber.</p>\n</section>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The monks believed this beautiful tree possessed unique spiritual properties, specifically that its roots extended deep beyond the Material Plane and into the Great Beyond, where it intertwined with its sister tree in the Serene Circle, Irori’s realm on the lawful plane of Axis. Whether or not this is true, many monks preferred to meditate beneath the branches of this tree.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Creature: The Broken Rebus met its end in this chamber. Mortally wounded, the leader of the group—a monk named Kannitri—made her way to the meditation tree. She sat down and pondered the attack and her actions before eventually passing away. Her mixed feelings—remorse, indignation, sorrow, anger—created enormous turmoil within her soul, but before she could resolve her clouded mind, her body expired. Now, her restless spirit lingers here as a ghost. She is not bound to her remains but chooses to remain in this room anyway.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">When the player characters enter, Kannitri rises from her remains and desperately pleads for forgiveness. The characters can attempt a DC 33 Deception or Diplomacy check to convince Kannitri that they forgive her; any character wearing a holy symbol of Irori gains a +2 circumstance bonus on this check. On a success, Kannitri finds momentary peace and becomes pacified for 1 hour, making no attempts to harm the characters during this time. On a critical success, she becomes pacified for 24 hours. If the characters speak with Kannitri’s ghost while she is pacified, she explains the history of the temple, the Broken Rebus, and the temple’s final moments. Kannitri explains her remorse and states that she wishes to be with her fellow disciples once more. She explains that most of her friends perished in the courtyard before their names (or hers) could be inscribed on the pagoda sculpture there. The characters might realize that burying Kannitri’s remains in the courtyard or carving her name into the pagoda will bring her peace; a character who succeeds at a DC 30 Religion check can deduce this.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If the characters don’t pacify Kannitri, she flies into a rage when she realizes they’re not her fellow monks.

Channeling the storm was too much for her, and she expired shortly thereafter. Her spirit remained, however, and it relives its final moments over and over again in this chamber.

Thin stone pillars carved with representations of the Master’s Rebus line the path on both sides. A small metal brazier rests atop each pillar. The braziers are currently unlit and empty.</p>\n<section class=\"readaloud\">\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">A simple dirt path leads up to a large pair of wooden doors bearing numerous intricate carvings. Two statues, each of an androgynous human, stand to either side of the doors, though the southern statue has been knocked over and now lies in pieces in the grass. Large webs cover the temple door and the exterior walls to the northwest and southwest. Something massive writhes in the thick webs that cover the northwest wall.</p>\n</section>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Creatures: A pair of mated goliath spiders make their nest on the roof and sides of the temple entrance. Their massive webs cover the entire rooftop and all the spaces immediately adjacent to the walls and front doors. The webs are difficult terrain. Clearing a square of webbing requires a single attack or effect that deals at least 10 slashing damage or 5 fire damage. A square has AC 5, and it automatically fails saving throws. If the web takes at least 5 fire damage, it catches on fire; each turn, the fire burns away the webs in that space and spreads to any adjacent webbed squares. A creature that starts its turn in a burning square takes 5 fire damage.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The webs covering area <strong>A1a </strong>must be destroyed before the temple’s doors can be opened. Area <strong>A1b</strong>’s webs are thick enough for a character to climb up to the temple’s flat stone rooftop. At area <strong>A1c</strong>, the spiders’ latest meal—a badly wounded but still living triceratops—lies half-cocooned in webs and stuck to the temple’s exterior wall. Destroying the webs around the triceratops frees it to flail about, enraged, for 2 rounds before fleeing into the forest.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The spiders are sleeping atop the roof when the party arrives. The characters can make Stealth checks against the spiders’ Perception DCs (32) to avoid waking them up; if disturbed, the spiders immediately attack. The spiders are initially a bit sluggish, and are slowed 1 for the first 2 rounds of combat. They crawl down from the rooftop and focus on any Small combatants. If their webs are totally burned away or if they are each reduced to 40 Hit Points or fewer, the spiders flee into the forest.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Goliath Spiders (2), Perception </strong></li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Wounded Triceratops, Perception</strong></li>\n</ul>","img":"","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wgjTDLixUZ8YXqS9":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"},"cf":{"id":"temp_ksy3ykjj0tf","color":"#000000"}}}

(These rules become more important starting in Chapter 2; consider offering your players a written list of the rules for easy reference.) She also hands the characters a scroll which details these instructions and features a basic map of Bonmu. The map shows the general topography and geographical features of the island and also notes the locations of the five transport towers.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\">Basic Rules</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The qualifying round has a number of ground rules.</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align:justify\">\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:4px\">The commands of the emissary and his agents are to be obeyed at all times, and the emissary’s word is final. None shall take violent action against the emissary or his agents.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:4px\">The emissary employs a number of enforcers to maintain order on the island. The enforcers are agents of the emissary and so have the authority to declare unique challenges and matches.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:4px\">To qualify for the Ruby Phoenix Tournament, a team must collect a total of 10 silver feathers. A team can attempt to earn feathers by challenging another team to a match and wagering feathers.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:4px\">All teams must be able to readily present their phoenix necklace (page 75) and at least 1 silver feather to the emissary or his enforcers. Failure to do so will result in immediate disqualification.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:4px\">No contestant may leave Bonmu, for any reason, until the conclusion of the qualifying round, unless they are disqualified or lose all of their silver feathers.</li>\n<li style=\"padding-bottom:4px\">The qualifying round lasts a total of 3 days. On the third day, any team with a complete set of silver feathers can visit Mount Haminabu to confirm their entry into the tournament by presenting their necklace and 10 feathers. Once eight teams have qualified for the tournament, the qualifying round is over, and all remaining teams are immediately disqualified.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\">Contests</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">To earn silver feathers, teams must engage other teams in official fighting matches. Teams can challenge one another to a match at any time once the qualifying round begins except for designated safe hours (every night from midnight to sunrise). A team must challenge another team in the presence of an enforcer. A challenged team must accept the challenge or be disqualified.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Once a match has been declared, the challengers must wager between one and three feathers. The defenders must then match the wager; if a defending team can’t match the wager, they must wager their remaining feathers. Once the wagers are placed, the feathers are handed to the enforcer, who takes both teams to the nearest designated fighting site (areas <strong>A</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, or <strong>F</strong>). Teams can also agree to fight one another without making a wager, in which case they are free to fight anywhere on the island, and the defending team isn’t required to accept the challenge. Once at the fighting area, the challenge begins. Only the two teams are allowed to participate in the challenge. Neither team can accept aid from anyone not participating in the challenge. The challenge is a free-for-all between both teams. The last team standing is the winner. A team can choose to yield and forfeit at any time during the challenge. Failing to honor the forfeit results in a disqualification. The slaying of an entrant during a challenge is entirely possible and permitted, but if an agent of the emissary catches any team attempting to lethally harm an entrant outside of a challenge, that team is disqualified.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Once one side has fallen or forfeited, the enforcer declares a winner and provides the winning team all of the wagered feathers. If the transfer of feathers would grant a team more than 10 total feathers, any excess feathers go to the enforcers and are taken out of play from the qualifying round. There are no ties in challenges and in the rare case where a winner is not immediately obvious, the enforcer has final say on declaring the winner. In addition to earning the feathers, the winning team also earns a bonus of 500 gp for winning a challenge. The enforcers are free to add to the winnings as they see fit in cases of particularly spectacular or memorable matches. Looting of defeated teams is permissible only if all members of the losing team have been killed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">After a match, the winning team can’t challenge the losing team again for the duration of the event. The losing team doesn’t have this restriction, however, and can challenge a team that has beaten them to rematches until the losing team either runs out of feathers or wins. Finally, any team with 10 or more feathers is prohibited from issuing challenges to other teams, though other teams are still allowed to challenge them</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\">Enforcers</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Rather than send in their own priests, the church of Abadar has recruited capable fighters to help maintain order on Bonmu and act as judges. These enforcers have the power to oversee challenges and directly interfere when any team breaks the rules.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In addition to acting as referees, the enforcers are a type of rival team themselves. An enforcer or group of enforcers can challenge any contending team on the island to a match. The enforcers are not required to wager any feather tokens, though they may require the defending team to wager up to 3 feathers. This process is intended to thin the pool of available feathers and make it more difficult for some of the teams to acquire the 10 feathers they need to qualify. If a challenged team defeats the enforcers, the winners earn 500 gp instead of silver feathers. Of course, no lethal action may be taken against the enforcers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The enforcers also have the power to declare unique challenges that don’t involve a fighting match. These challenges are designed to encourage the teams to travel the island and overcome the environment. To entice teams to participate in these challenges, the enforcers possess a number of additional silver feathers that they can give out as rewards to the challenge winners.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Though the emissary is ultimately in charge of all the tournament agents on the island, including the enforcers, he has delegated command of the enforcers to an onidoshi named Koto Zekora. Koto Zekora is considered the final arbiter of any enforcer decisions, and her authority is second only to that of the emissary. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p>","img":"","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wgjTDLixUZ8YXqS9":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"},"cf":{"id":"temp_h9jf0p7uwu","color":"#000000"}}}

Each sister studied at the Houses of Perfection in Jalmeray and learned to master a specific element to include with their techniques. Manyala practiced her control over fire at the Monastery of Unblinking Flame, while Rijana underwent tutelage in the Monastery of Unbreaking Waves to learn control over ice.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The twins bring the enforcers who visited the temple an hour earlier and officially declare their challenge against the characters just as the sun rises. They wager two of their silver feathers for the match. The adventure assumes the characters have the match at the temple of Irori, though they are free to move it to a nearby fighting site if they prefer.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In combat, the sisters stay close together to make it more difficult to flank them. They make liberal use of their ki blast spell and their Channel Element abilities. Manyala surrenders if reduced to fewer than 50 Hit Points, but Rijana continues to fight until knocked unconscious or reduced to 0 Hit Points.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Manyala and Rijana Ahmoza</strong> (female Vudran weak ki adepts)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>New Feat: </strong>If the player characters win the match, Manyala and Rijana are genuinely impressed by the party’s skill. In addition to the reward for winning the match, they offer to teach the characters one of their powerful techniques. This process requires 1 hour and 2 hexploration activities but earns the party access to the Entwined Energy Ki feat (page 74).</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Event 2: Challenge of the Enforcers</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Sometime after the characters collect 5 silver feathers, they catch the attention of a group of tournament enforcers. The group’s leader, a hobgoblin monk by the name of Gomwai, attended the last Ruby Phoenix Tournament as a pawn of the Golden League, a notorious Gokan crime syndicate, and even made it to the final round before ultimately losing to the champions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Gomwai’s loss gave him an opportunity for significant self-reflection and a reassessment of his values. He felt great shame for his involvement with the Golden League and chose to step away from his criminal connections to become a mercenary bodyguard for important business leaders in Goka. When the church of Abadar started recruiting staff for this year’s tournament, Gomwai leapt at the opportunity, wishing to give back to the tournament that had done so much for him. Gomwai earned a place as an enforcer, and he leads a small group of less experienced fighters-turned-enforcers in the pre-qualifier.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Now, Gomwai has received orders from Koto Zekora, the enforcer leader, to thin out some of the silver feathers. The player characters happen to be the nearest team when Gomwai gets his orders.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creatures: </strong>Gomwai and his squad of enforcers find the characters and challenge them to a match for 2 silver feathers. The match itself has no additional wrinkles and is a simple fight. Gomwai uses Flurry of Blows to Trip as many targets as possible, then lets the other enforcers come in and take advantage of the opening. If the characters take out two members of the squad, the remaining enforcer surrenders and declares the player characters the match’s winners.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>2 Enforcers</strong></li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Gomwai </strong>(male hobgoblin tournament enforcer)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Prize:</strong> If the player characters win the challenge, Gomwai rewards them with 1,500 gp in addition to the standard 500 gp they earn for winning the match. In addition, Gomwai presents them with a phoenix idol in the shape of a rising phoenix. The characters can sell this idol or use it to turn down a match as noted in area <strong>J5 </strong>(page 37).</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Event 3: The Spiteful Cauthooj</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Among the many creatures already living on Bonmu, one of the most intelligent is an old cauthooj who has lived on the island for over a century. During that time, the cauthooj enjoyed easy access to food and plenty of small treasures on Bonmu. When the tournament staff started making preparations on the island, they piqued the cauthooj’s interest. Once the prequalifying round began in earnest, the cauthooj saw an opportunity to snag more baubles and treasures from the new arrivals.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The cauthooj likes to sneak up on resting contenders and steal small trinkets like gems or even silver feathers. This event can occur any time the player characters are exploring, resting between fights, or getting their bearings.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creature:</strong> The old cauthooj attempts to sneak up on the characters, using Stealth for its initiative. It attempts to walk into the group, grab the nearest trinket, and run away. If the cauthooj acts first in initiative, it catches the characters unawares. In this case, the characters are slowed 1 for the first round of combat. The cauthooj attempts to take the characters’ phoenix necklace first and foremost.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If the cauthooj manages to slip away with an item, the characters can attempt to Track the cauthooj and reclaim their lost bauble. Doing so requires a successful DC 32 Survival check. Once the characters are on the hunt, they can find the cauthooj after following the trail for 10 minutes. The cauthooj tries to run away from combat again, requiring the characters to Track the cauthooj again if it escapes. This continues until the third time the characters Track it. Tired of running, the cauthooj stands its ground to fight. If the cauthooj is reduced to fewer than 50 Hit Points, it drops its treasures as a distraction and runs away for good. The cauthooj also withdraws if the player characters are able to reclaim their stolen item.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Elder Cauthooj</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Treasure: The cauthooj sees all of Bonmu as its domain and thus doesn’t keep a lair of any sort. Instead, it uses a small bag found during its initial days on the island to carry all of its treasures. The cauthooj keeps the bag around its neck and places any baubles it picks up inside.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If the characters are able to claim the bag, they find a fair amount of junk but also a few true treasures, including a balisse feather; a piece of dispelling silver; a light brown elemental gem; an eye of apprehension; a glowing, thin glass rod which turns out to be a wand of crackling lightning (6th level; Advanced Player’s Guide 265); a runestone that glows with faint, crimson light due to its greater flaming rune; and a greater ring of cold resistance.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Event 4: A Desperate Struggle</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Late in the day, a different team finds the characters and begins a new match.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creatures: </strong>This team is a group of spellcasters from Avistan known as the Glowing Embers. While they’re accomplished wizards, they were not prepared for the rigors of the qualifying round. Namely, their inexperience with close-quarters combat led them to be overwhelmed by opponents able to quickly close the gap on them on the battlefield.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The Glowing Embers wager their 1 remaining silver feather against the player characters. They start the match strong, breaking up the battlefield with areas of black tentacles, but after 3 rounds the fatigue of the day’s earlier events sets in. All their members become clumsy 1 and enfeebled 1 for the remainder of the match.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If the player characters win, the Glowing Embers offer them a half-spirited congratulations before following the enforcers toward the docks to leave the island.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>4 Glowing Embers Members </strong>(human weak mage of many styles)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Event 5: Saving the Cloud Jesters</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Just as the characters begin to wind down for the day, they get swept up in another team’s potentially deadly mistake.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creatures: </strong>A team of adventurers named the Cloud Jesters decided to explore a small, hidden tomb. During their exploration, they activated several stone golems guarding the tomb. While the Jesters managed to hold the sentries off for a time, they recognized a losing battle and chose to run away.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The player characters happen to pass by at the right moment to hear the Cloud Jesters screaming for help as they flee the tomb. If the characters decide to help, they can follow the screams to find the Cloud Jesters several hundred feet away. Injured from the fight, most of the Cloud Jesters have collapsed by the time the characters find them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The stone golems are attempting to reclaim a stolen treasure from the Cloud Jesters but will turn on the characters if attacked by them. The Cloud Jesters are too injured to aid in the fight.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Stone Golems</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Treasure:</strong> If the characters destroy the golems and save the Cloud Jesters, the team offers their sincerest thanks and gives them the frost brand they stole from the tomb as a reward, believing the sword to have been too much trouble to be worth keeping anyway.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If the characters take longer than 10 minutes to come find the source of the screams, the stone golems have already finished off the Cloud Jesters and left with the stolen weapon. There’s no sign of the golems anywhere, and only the corpses of the Cloud Jesters remain. The characters can claim the Cloud Jesters’ equipment if they wish, as there are no enforcers around to stop them. The Cloud Jesters were an agile warrior, archery specialist, mage of many styles, and weapon master (pages 23–25) and have the appropriate equipment. In addition, the Cloud Jester’s leader carries the team’s two remaining silver feathers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p>","img":null,"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wgjTDLixUZ8YXqS9":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"type":"base","scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.hRkhdlbXzuCBr9vf"},"cf":{"id":"temp_sb55ol5wixk"}}}

Use the following teams whenever the player characters actively search for other teams or when you feel like introducing some excitement to the exploration. If the characters purposefully search for a team, they typically find a group of challengers within 4 hexploration actions. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">At your consideration, the player characters might face these teams at a lower or higher level than presented here. You can modify teams’ threat levels by applying the weak or elite creature adjustments (page 6 of the Pathfinder Bestiary) to the team’s fighters. The ultimate decision is up to you, but know that some of the teams will be too difficult for lower-level teams. On the other hand, such a fight can be a perfect way to remind the player characters that they are not unbeatable. Regardless of whether they win or lose, the characters should earn experience for these fights as long as they gave an honest effort for the match. In the case of a loss, award the characters experience for a challenge one threat level lower than the fight’s threat level (low-threat experience for a moderate threat, moderate-threat experience for a severe threat, and so on).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If these teams don’t fit your needs for an encounter, consider using the Ruby Phoenix Fighting Roster article (page 66) to develop a team concept. From there, you can use the base combatant statistics (page 22) to fill your team with different opponents. </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Lightning Callers</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creatures: </strong>The Lightning Callers are a pair of expert archers from Osirion. <strong>Morginnar </strong>and <strong>Rameis </strong>do their best to keep away from opponents in combat. If there is higher ground for them to use, they quickly make their way toward that location first. Otherwise, they attempt to pin their opponents before moving away. Both Morginnar and Rameis fight until reduced to 25 Hit Points, at which point they surrender.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Morginna </strong><strong>Rameis </strong>(human archery specialists)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Nightmares</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The Nightmares are a trio of horse riders from the Xopatl region of Arcadia. Named after the fiendish horses of death—which they’ve outfitted their mounts to resemble—the Nightmares dress in black robes and wield polearms against their foes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creatures: </strong>Junerio, Rovidar, and Tairino are cousins who grew up together and got by as thieves. They eventually realized they could avoid all the subterfuge and sneaking around by instead simply terrifying their victims into submission. In combat, the trio encircle one or two opponents at a time, staying mounted and using their halberds to attack from a safe distance. All of the Nightmares fight until knocked out.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Junerio, Rovidar, Tairino </strong>(human agile warriors)</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>3 Specialist War Horses</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Golarion's Finest</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The eight fighters who call themselves Golarion’s Finest met at a previous worldwide tournament many years ago. They all enjoyed their time together so much that they formed their own team. Since then, they’ve entered multiple tournaments, traveling around Golarion in search of their next fight. Their incredible winning record earned them a place among Hao Jin’s chosen pre-qualifiers for the Ruby Phoenix Tournament.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creatures:</strong> Each of Golarion’s Finest specializes in a specific technique. The Quain fraternal twins Han and Jun have each mastered their punches and kicks respectively. Mingyu was a former teacher from Goka who found an even greater passion in fighting. Krankkiss and Rajna attended a monastery in Vudra where they mastered the flow of ki in their bodies to grant them unusual abilities. Paunnima, a retired wrestling champion from Minkai, took to fighting once again to raise funds for her tea shop. Numoriz was a Razatlani knight, but he retired after the birth of his son; now that his son is an adult, Numoriz has returned to the world of combat but avoided the call to war. Finally, Brartork, an Iobarian body builder, can be credited with the original idea of forming Golarion’s Finest. His gregarious and joyful attitude immediately falls to the wayside in combat, as he takes his grappling and throwing very seriously in order to subdue his opponents. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In combat, Golarion’s Finest each try to focus on separate foes, though the large size of the group usually ends with the team breaking into pairs. Han and Jun fight together, attempting to keep a foe pinned down. Krankkiss and Rajna use their unique abilities to take the defensive. Mingyu and Paunnima use their quick attacks to pummel multiple foes at once. Finally, Brartork and Numoriz cover any leftover opponents. Each member surrenders if reduced to fewer than 50 Hit Points.

Numerous reasons to accept this invitation abound, some of which are described in the sidebar on page 3. Answer any general questions your players have about the Ruby Phoenix Tournament, summarizing the details on the preceding pages (except, of course, anything about the Adventure Path’s antagonist, Syndara the Sculptor).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This adventure begins when the player characters arrive on Bonmu for the qualifying round of the Ruby Phoenix Tournament. How and when the characters reach Bonmu is up to you, but this adventure assumes that they arrive via a large ship that departed from a city such as Goka, Kasai, or Absalom. They have had at least a few days to meet with some of the other tournament entrants aboard their ship; feel free to play out some of these meetings so the characters can to get to know some of the other teams and establish some friendships or rivalries. The “Ruby Phoenix Fighting Roster” article on page 66 offers information on the pre-qualifier’s most notable teams.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">However they get to the island, the party’s first stop is the docks (area <strong>B1</strong>, on the southwest coast of the island, as seen on the inner cover map), where all of the entrants line up while they stretch, practice techniques, and spar with each other. The air buzzes with anticipation. After a few minutes, a cloister of red-and-gold-outfitted monks arrives at the docks and calls the assembly to order. One monk meets with each team and introduces themself as the team’s attendant and guide for the duration of their time on Bonmu; the player characters’ guide, Ingdani, is described below, under Setting Out. Eventually, an old man wearing brilliant robes arrives by boat at the docks. All the monks bow to the man before he begins his speech.</p>\n<section class=\"readaloud\">\n<p>A hush falls over the crowd as the wizened man steps onto one of the docks and clears his throat. Even the ocean’s waves seem to cease their crashing for a dramatic moment, and then the man speaks in a loud and clear voice.</p>\n<p>“I am Sifu Xho Nuo—Emissary of the Ruby Phoenix Tournament and guardian of the legacy of Hao Jin, the immortal sorcerer in whose name you are gathered here. Know that in simply receiving an invitation to qualify for the tournament, you have already earned a place among the greatest fighters Golarion has ever known. However, only eight teams may continue on to the tournament proper, and that is why you are here today. Welcome to the island of Bonmu, or, as dubbed by Lady Hao Jin, ‘Danger Island.’ This will be your home for the next few days, and it is here where you will earn the right to enter the tournament.</p>\n<p>“Bonmu is vast. It is a place of ancient ruins and sites left untouched by the centuries. Lady Hao Jin has reclaimed this place and picked out a suitable location for each team to reside during their stay. Of course, nothing is given freely at the Ruby Phoenix Tournament. Each team has been assigned a specific location somewhere on this island, but many of these sites are filled with dangerous creatures or worse. It falls to you to make your site safe. Within your residence you will find the phoenix necklace and three silver feathers. Your mission here is to acquire and keep seven more such silver feathers.</p>\n<p>“Without further delay, I leave you to the whims of Bonmu. The pre-qualifier begins at sunrise tomorrow. May the worthiest win!” At that, the teams burst into excited conversations with their escorts and rush toward their residences.

The Tian-Sings built the temple to serve as a monastery for monks of Irori. Shortly before the island’s abandonment, an uprising within the monks’ ranks led to the death of everyone within the temple. This violent fate created several ghosts who now haunt the dilapidated temple.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">When it came time to prepare the temple for the tournament, Sifu Xho Nuo and his emissaries moved quickly through the place, dropping the <em>phoenix necklace</em> and silver feathers into rooms without lingering.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Temple Features:</strong> Bonmu’s temple of Irori is small compared to some other Iroran centers of worship. The monastery was intended for only two dozen permanent residents at most. Its interior walls are made from the same worked stone as the exterior but feature carvings in the form of prayers and the Master’s Rebus, a symbol said to represent knowledge, enlightenment, and Irori himself. These magically enhanced carvings emit a dim blue light within all the interior rooms. Anyone inside one of the temple’s rooms can utter Irori’s name to suppress or reactivate the room’s light; suppressed lights automatically reactivate after 8 hours.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The temple has only three entrances, at areas <strong>A1</strong>, <strong>A4</strong>, and <strong>A6</strong>, though some recent damage makes for easy access into area <strong>A13 </strong>as well. All of the doors are made from thick wood and are unlocked. The exterior doors sport interior brackets to ease with barring the door, though the wooden beams once used for this purpose are missing. The ceilings of the temple are 15 feet high unless otherwise noted. A number of rooms lack ceilings entirely, leaving areas <strong>A3</strong>, <strong>A7</strong>, <strong>A10</strong>, and <strong>A11 </strong>exposed to the elements. See page 14 for the map of the temple.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>The Broken Rebus:</strong> A century ago, a small but vibrant community of Iroran monks spent their entire lives within this temple’s walls. All that came to an end when a splinter group in the order attempted to take the temple for themselves. This group, known as the Broken Rebus, believed that enlightenment came not through knowledge or meditation but through outright might, which they argued represented the pinnacle of the physical self and allowed one to transcend into the spiritual realm. This extreme belief soon became twisted into a hunger for power. The Broken Rebus’s last resort—a violent takeover of the temple—failed, but they did manage to mortally wound all their fellow monks during the attack, spelling the end for the temple. Signs of the Broken Rebus, including undead monks and deadly hazards, still occupy much of the temple.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-1.BivxBcTGTcuZLBX3]{A1.

He has since remained here, slowly restoring the building.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Any battle outside the temple or in an adjacent room catches Ahmitar’s attention, in which case he watches the characters from a safe distance and steps back to his spot in the chamber before he’s noticed. When the characters enter the chamber, he watches them closely. If someone examines his tools or food, he hops out of his workspace and pleads with them to leave his things alone. Ahmitar’s quivering voice makes it obvious he is fearful of the fighters. He demands to know why they’re here, concerned that they intend to damage the temple, but he lights up if the characters mention that they are here to clear the temple of its monsters, in which case he regards them as friends. Otherwise, convincing Ahmitar that they mean no harm or asking him to leave them alone should be a simple process; the last thing Ahmitar wants is a confrontation with these formidable visitors.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If the characters befriend Ahmitar, he makes a valuable ally indeed. Ahmitar eagerly tells the party all about the temple, including its layout, the state of various rooms, and the creatures that dwell within. He happily follows and helps however he can, though he retreats to his workspace if his life is in danger. Once the temple is cleared out, Ahmitar remains, fixing up any unfinished cosmetic repairs and providing companionship throughout the contenders’ stay. Additionally, Ahmitar traveled through most of Bonmu before settling at the temple. He can inform the characters of Bonmu’s history and the basic details of most locations on the island, though he doesn’t know about locations’ specific inhabitants or secrets.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If the party asks Ahmitar to leave, he dejectedly acquiesces. If attacked, Ahmitar immediately flees to his workspace or into the forest if necessary. In this case, he attempts to sneak back into the temple throughout the adventure in an attempt to continue his work, fleeing at the first sign that the contenders have noticed him.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Ahmitar</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>XP Award:</strong> If the characters befriend Ahmitar, award each 30 XP.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p>","img":"","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wgjTDLixUZ8YXqS9":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"},"cf":{"id":"temp_ksy3ykjj0tf","color":"#000000"}}}
{"_id":"jZ4bK0gnAhYMZ3Jt","name":"Traveling on Bonmu","content":"<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-1.w81sKG50X9aHOO1L]{Chapter 2: Survive}</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Bonmu is a large island, about 6 miles in length and just over half that distance wide. Travel through Bonmu uses a modified version of the hexploration rules found on pages 170–173 of the Pathfinder Gamemastery Guide. Rather than exploration taking up days at a time, hexploration on Bonmu is broken into half-hour increments. Sixteen hours of each day are “active hours,” during which the characters can fight other teams and earn silver feathers to qualify for the Ruby Phoenix Tournament. The remaining 8 hours, roughly between 12 a.m. and 8 a.m., are designated as “inactive hours,” during which matches are prohibited.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The characters have no need to map Bonmu or establish a camp, as they have a dedicated headquarters within the temple of Irori and receive a map from Ingdani. Thus, there is no need to use the individual hexploration activities described in the Gamemastery Guide. As every hex on Bonmu is only a half-mile wide, even the slowest group can make significant progress across the island in the course of a day, and can complete a much larger number of activities due to this smaller scale. Assuming they rest 8 hours per day, characters receive a total of 32 hexploration activities per day, regardless of the group’s moving speed. To accommodate for the smaller scale of Bonmu, the Travel and Reconnoiter hexploration group activities should be modified as follows.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The player characters can travel around the island at all hours of the day but can Engage in a Match only during active hours. However, any travel during inactive hours could potentially eat into valuable time for rest. All other teams are assumed to be taking their period of rest during inactive hours. If the player characters choose to rest at another time, they run the risk of another team challenging them to a match and disrupting their rest.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p>","img":"","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wgjTDLixUZ8YXqS9":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"type":"base","scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.hRkhdlbXzuCBr9vf"},"cf":{"id":"temp_gbhn0a6fdhk"}}}

{"_id":"nKSPGoVO5jv4prXQ","name":"The Ruby Phoenix Tournament","content":"<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-1.4cZGWFracfL74Ge0]{Chapter 1: Welcome to Danger Island}</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This year’s Ruby Phoenix Tournament promises to be unlike any before it—because the Ruby Phoenix herself will be there!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In 4719 AR, as the church of Abadar continued their usual preparations for the 32nd Ruby Phoenix Tournament, the unexpected occurred: Hao Jin returned to Goka. The church scrambled to determine its next steps as the contract with the sorcerer assumed her death, which was obviously not the case. Hao Jin recognized the importance of the tournament and was content with continuing the tradition, so long as she had her share of input into the process. The church agreed, and Hao Jin immediately began making changes to the tournament’s format.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Rather than permit several dozens or even hundreds of entrants, Hao Jin hand-selected and approved just 32 teams of fighters. The teams included competitors from other major tournaments around Golarion, famous and up-and-coming martial artists, and even notable adventuring groups. Hao Jin chose these contestants with consideration not only for their martial prowess, but also for their anticipated entertainment value.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">After picking the teams, Hao Jin made one more significant change to the tournament process: rather than simply setting the teams against each other in a tournament bracket, the Ruby Phoenix created a large preliminary qualifying round. In this round, all teams will compete against each other in a multi-day freefor-all that tests their survival skills, teamwork, and mental fortitude. Only the top eight teams from this preliminary round will qualify to enter the Ruby Phoenix Tournament’s main event. So, Hao Jin’s 32 teams have traveled to the remote island of Bonmu, where they will compete against one another for three grueling days until the pool is whittled down to just eight finalists.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Hao Jin remains unaware of the machinations of her old friend turned bitter rival, Syndara the Sculptor. Free at last from the Hao Jin Tapestry, Syndara saw the sorcerer’s return to the Material Plane as his opportunity for vengeance. To enact his plot, Syndara first enlisted powerful martial artists from around Golarion to fight on his behalf. He pulled strings in Goka to have one of Hao Jin’s hand-picked teams, the Lightkeepers, secretly murdered so that his allies could take their place. Syndara believes that he can use this team to lure Hao Jin to the demiplane where he’s been trapped for centuries, so that he can finally—and permanently—murder the Ruby Phoenix. Whether his plan will come to fruition, however, depends largely on how the Lightkeepers fare against their most challenging rivals: the player characters.</p>","img":"","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wgjTDLixUZ8YXqS9":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"},"cf":{"id":"temp_0qowe1ymurfh","color":"#000000"}}}
{"_id":"rkBya0qYaHb3IyO8","name":"Bonmu Locations","content":"<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-1.w81sKG50X9aHOO1L]{Chapter 2: Survive}</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Although Bonmu is smaller than some of the other Minatan islands, it’s full of interesting sites. The following locations correspond to the points indicated on the map on the inside cover of this volume.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>A. Temple of Irori</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This is the characters’ headquarters for their stay on Bonmu. This location is fully detailed in Chapter 1.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>B. Docks</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In addition to the docks on the western side of the island where all of the contestants arrived (area B1), there are two other notable docks. The docks at B2 allow access to the small island just off of Bonmu’s southern shore, and characters can use the docks at B3 to reach the small chain of islands at the northeast end of Bonmu. A number of rowboats are stationed at each of these docks at all hours of the day, allowing passage to and from the main island.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>C. Fighting Sites</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The enforcers prepared sizable areas around the isle of Bonmu for competitors to use as fighting arenas. These sites are scattered throughout the island and are assumed to be located in one of five different types of terrain: beach, forest, mountain, river, or ruins.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">When the characters Engage in a Match, find the nearest suitable location: either a fighting site or a team headquarters. Each competing team must take the appropriate downtime activity to travel to this location. If the match takes place in a fighting site, determine the most likely terrain and use the appropriate map (page 28, 30, 32, or 34, or the rear inside cover). Each fighting site has its own unique features.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Beach Site</span><br /></strong>A wrecked ship rests along the coast of this cliffside beach. The northern cliff wall rises to a height of 10 feet, and scaling the wall requires a successful DC 25 Athletics check to Climb. The rocks on the southeastern end of the beach are piled 25 feet high but require only a successful DC 20 Athletics check to Climb. The shipwreck is 10 feet off the ground at its highest point near the bow; scaling it requires a successful DC 15 Athletics check to Climb. The precarious nature of the leaning ship requires a successful DC 15 Acrobatics check to Balance when moving across it.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Forest Site</span><br /></strong>This oval fighting arena was used for tournaments and performances during the Tian-Sing occupation of Bonmu, and its ruins have been repurposed for the Ruby Phoenix Tournament’s pre-qualifier. The lava rock walls around the arena rise to a height of 10 feet and can be Climbed with a successful DC 25 Athletics check. The half-rotted foliage of a fallen breadfruit tree functions as difficult terrain; the tree’s trunk is not difficult terrain, but it is a narrow surface that requires a successful DC 15 Acrobatics check to Balance. The stagnant pool of water in the arena’s northwestern corner is deceptively deep, sinking to a depth of 3 feet. The water is difficult terrain for Medium creatures; smaller creatures must Swim through the water.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Mountain Site</span><br /></strong>A deep ravine runs through this mountain pass. Climbing up or down the rock ledges requires a A deep ravine runs through this mountain pass. Climbing up or down the rock ledges requires a</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The rickety suspension bridge that crosses over the ravine is stable enough to support one Large creature, two Medium creatures, or four Small creatures. If the bridge’s capacity is exceeded, roll a flat DC 10 check at the end of the round. On a failure, the bridge collapses, sending creatures on it tumbling into the ravine. Alternatively, a creature can intentionally damage the bridge with a successful DC 30 Athletics check or by dealing a total of 30 slashing damage to one of the bridge’s ropes.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">River Site</span><br /></strong>A small shrine and set of statues dot this peaceful river site. At the head of the river, a waterfall pours into a 15-foot-deep pool. A set of damaged stone platforms allows access to the statue of a long-forgotten Taumatan god. The constant spray of water from the falls makes these platforms slick; a creature who jumps onto them must attempt a DC 20 Acrobatics check to Balance when landing on the platform. On a failure, the creature falls prone. On a critical failure, they slip into the water below.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Ruins Site</span><br /></strong><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">A small shrine and set of statues dot this peaceful river site. At the head of the river, a waterfall pours into a 15-foot-deep pool. A set of damaged stone platforms allows access to the statue of a long-forgotten Taumatan god. The constant spray of water from the falls makes these platforms slick; a creature who jumps onto them must attempt a DC 20 Acrobatics check to Balance when landing on the platform. On a failure, the creature falls prone. On a critical failure, they slip into the water below.</span> </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>D. Transport Towers</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The original Taumatan inhabitants of Bonmu enchanted five tiered black towers that allowed them to quickly travel across the island. The original intent was to use this travel network to connect all of the islands of Minata, but the Taumatans were unable to perfect the method required for travel across greater distances.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The travel network remains intact to this day, allowing the Ruby Phoenix Tournament’s contenders to make miles-long journeys across the island in mere seconds. A total of five transport towers dot the island, each connected to all the others. The towers themselves resemble towering, narrow pagodas and contain a main chamber on the ground floor with four hallways, each terminating in a magical gate that connects to another tower. The rest of each tower rises a hundred or so feet into the air, making it a simple matter to spot the nearest tower from anywhere on the island.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Per tournament rules, the towers are neutral territory, and any attempts to fight inside or within 50 feet of the towers is grounds for disqualification. A group of officiants is posted at every tower to enforce this rule.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Spell Reward: </strong>Once the player characters visit all five towers, an officiant offers to teach them the return beacon spell (page 77).</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>E. Stone Markets</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Knowing that competitors would need access to armor, weapons, and supplies, Hao Jin tasked the church of Abadar with creating a few specific huts on Bonmu that would connect to the markets of the Cliffside Court in Goka. The church set up a few simple stone buildings, each with an extraplanar link to the markets, which they dubbed the Stone Markets.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Anyone who visits a Stone Market can enter the building to find a small extraplanar window on one side of a plain stone room. On the other side of the extraplanar window waits a merchant from the Cliffside Court. The patron can speak with the merchant as if they were in the same building, and the merchant can deliver goods through the window, but this is a one-way effect—only the merchant has been magically attuned to the window, so any attempts from a patron to reach through the portal fail. Payment must be handed over to the enforcer attending the Stone Market for future delivery to the merchant.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The merchants have the entirety of the Cliffside Court’s wares available and can sell common items of up to 16th level, many imported to Goka in anticipation of the Ruby Phoenix Tournament. The merchants are also willing to buy items from patrons, which they sell to tourists as unique, genuine souvenirs previously owned by famous fighters. The merchants buy items at the normal rate of half their Price, or full Price for art objects, gems, and raw materials.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>F. Team Headquarters</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Every team in the qualifying pool has been assigned a structure on Bonmu to serve as their base of operations during their stay, such as the temple of Irori for the player characters. Every team occupies a different structure, all of which feature a suitable space for a match. A map of every headquarters is beyond the scope of this adventure, but you can use any of the fighting site maps (pages 28, 30, 32, 34, and the inside rear cover) or the map of the temple of Irori (page 14) to represent a match at one of the headquarters. The Headquarters Sites sidebar on page 27 lists all of the possible buildings that can serve as headquarters.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Most headquarters are unoccupied during the day, but there’s a 50% chance the player characters come upon the occupying team resting at their base during the hours just after sunrise or before sunset.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>G. Creature Dens</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Bonmu is home to a large number of megafauna, beasts, and other dangerous creatures. Most of these critters keep to themselves, but the characters will likely stumble upon a few dens while traveling around the island. If the characters Reconnoiter in a hex containing a den, they become aware of the den’s location and can choose to visit it. There’s a 50% chance that the creature or creatures are home when the player characters visit; otherwise they’re out elsewhere on the island. If a creature is home, it automatically moves to defend its nest from what it perceives as intruders, unless the characters successfully Avoid Notice when visiting the den. The various dens are described below.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">G1. Black Scorpion Den</span><br /></strong>This deadly <strong>black scorpion </strong>makes its residence in a beachside cove.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\">G2. Dread Roc Den<br /></strong></span>An ancient and powerful <strong>dread roc </strong>keeps a nest at the top of this small mountain. Reaching the den requires a successful DC 30 Athletics check to Climb the sheer cliffside where the nest is located.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\">G3. Mantis Den<br /></strong></span>A pair of <strong>elite deadly mantises </strong>keep a den among the jungle treetops.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\">G4. Mammoth Turtle Den<br /></strong></span>A powerful snapping turtle known as a <strong>mammoth turtle </strong>makes the majority of the beach here its home.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\">G5. Tyrannosaurus Den<br /></strong></span>An incredible specimen known as the <strong>tyrannosaurus imperator </strong>calls the hills of Bonmu its hunting ground. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\">G6. Cave Worm Den<br /></strong></span>A pair of mated <strong>purple worms </strong>reside in a deep coastal cavern here.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\">G7. Spinosaurus Den<br /></strong></span>A deadly spinosaurus, called the “<strong>grave spinosaurus</strong>” by the Tian-Sings who lived in fear of the ancient beast, keeps a den in a cove near the beach here. If it is not out hunting, there is a 50% chance that it is swimming in the water near the beach rather than staying inside the cove itself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\">G8. Dromornis Den<br /></strong></span>A pack of <strong>4</strong> <strong>dromornises </strong>live in a cave here among the tall coastal grasses. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\">G9. Caustic Monitor Cave<br /></strong></span>A lone <strong>caustic monitor lizard </strong>lives in a cave here.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\">G10. Solifugid Den<br /></strong></span>A <strong>young duneshaker solifugid </strong>has taken up residence among these beach dunes.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>H. Taumatan Shrines</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">While the people of Bonmu claimed and converted many of the existing temples and shrines on the island, they left several of the ancient Taumatan shrines alone. These shrines are still dedicated to obscure, but not quite forgotten, Taumatan deities and have secrets of their own to discover.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Each of these obscure deities has gone millennia without recognition or worship and is eager to reward anyone who acknowledges them. Recognizing a deity requires a successful DC 35 Religion check or DC 30 Bonmu Lore check to Recall Knowledge. In addition, if the player characters perform a specific act to honor the deity, as noted in each shrine’s respective entry, the characters earn a blessing from that deity. Once earned, these blessings are granted to the entire party of player characters. If the characters successfully recognize the deity, they also deduce the act required for honoring the deity.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If the players are at a complete loss for what to do with the shrines, Ahmitar (area <strong>A2</strong>) or Ingdani can explain the shrines’ basic history and suggest that the abandoned gods haven’t been worshipped in some time and might bless anyone who honors their shrines.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">H1. Shrine of Ahngonar</span><br /></strong>Also known as the Melodious Wind, Ahngonar was the Taumatan god of messengers, music, and love. Honoring Ahngonar requires performing a love song at his shrine. As a reward, he grants the characters the power of incorruptible messages. Each character can cast tongues as a divine innate spell once during their stay on Bonmu.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">H2. Shrine of Babbunabi</span><br /></strong>This was the Taumatan god of scripture, storytellers, and travelers. Honoring Babbunabi requires spending 10 minutes reading aloud at her shrine. Babbunabi rewards the characters with the gift of sight, granting them each a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws to prevent the blinded or dazzled conditions during their stay on Bonmu.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">H3. Shrine of Jinya-Por</span><br /></strong>Jinya-Por was the Taumatan god of sailing, swimming, and the wind. Swimming in the waters beside her shrine for at least 10 minutes is enough to honor her. As a reward, Jinya-Por grants the characters the gift of the currents. For the duration of their stay on Bonmu, whenever a character rolls a success at an Athletics check to Swim, they get a critical success instead.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">H4. Shrine of Kantiyani</span><br /></strong>Kantiyani was the Taumatan god of charity, feasts, and cooks. The characters must prepare and consume a meal at their shrine to honor them. As a reward, Kantiyani grants the characters full bellies with every meal. For the duration of their stay on Bonmu, they only have to eat a single meal per day to receive a full day’s worth of nourishment.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">H5. Shrine of Ni-Sa-Yei</span><br /></strong>Known as the Joyful Chronicler, Ni-Sa-Yei was the Taumatan god of maps, exploration, and foragers. Honoring Ni-Sa-Yei simply requires that the characters mark his shrine on their map of Bonmu. As a reward, the characters always know the location of any sites they’ve already visited for the duration of their stay, even if they lose their map, get lost, or have their memories altered.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">H6. Shrine of Ramijav</span><br /></strong>Ramijav was the Taumatan god of relaxation, self-care, and comedy. Resting at Ramijav’s shrine for at least 10 minutes is enough to honor them. As a reward, Ramijav grants the characters restful sleep for their stay at Bonmu, which allows them to recover from the fatigued condition by resting for only 1 hour.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">H7. Shrine of Shihandivara</span><br /></strong>This was the Taumatan god of games, competition, and boasting. Honoring Shihandivara requires playing a game at her shrine. This can be any simple game, so long as the characters play in earnest competition. As a reward, Shihandivara grants the characters a +1 circumstance bonus to all skill checks rolled during non-combat competitions while on Bonmu. This bonus does not apply during matches against other teams for silver feathers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">H8. Shrine of Ramijav</span><br /></strong>This was the Taumatan god of dance, revelry, and animal friendship. Any player character who dances for 10 minutes at Umantar’s shrine honors the god. As a reward, Umantar grants the characters lighter feet for the duration of their stay on Bonmu, allowing them to Step into non-magical difficult terrain.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Treasure:</strong> If the player characters manage to visit all of the island’s shrines during their stay and honor each of the gods, the Taumatan gods are delighted. At the last shrine they visit, the characters find a final reward from the Taumatan deities in the form of eight different native flowers, a pair of winged boots, a <em>greater resilient </em>rune inscribed on a <em>runestone</em>, and a <em>ring of climbing</em>, all laid neatly upon a fine silk blanket.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>I. Watchtowers</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The Tian-Sings of Bonmu kept several towers to watch for threats to the island such as attacking monsters, invaders, and dangerous weather. When these people abandoned the island due to the threat of kaiju, the watchtower keepers stayed behind until they could confirm the safe evacuation of the island’s populace. Unfortunately, just as the last of Bonmu’s citizens escaped, the worst came to pass: in the midst of a titanic fight between the kaijus King Mogaru and Frovith, the Void Duke, the latter unleashed a deadly beam of unlife from its infinite maw. Bonmu was directly in the path of the attack. The beam killed nearly all of Bonmu’s remaining inhabitants, including the watchtower keepers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">As Frovith and Mogaru moved their fight beyond Bonmu, the Void Duke’s power caused the keepers to rise as undead bound to their respective towers. These undead remain at the towers to this day, unable to leave Bonmu for over a century.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Each watchtower is an identical structure made from stone, 80 feet tall and featuring a large brazier on the rooftop to send signals across the island. The ceilings of each floor rise to a height of 20 feet. A map of one such watchtower appears on page 44.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Ia. Entryway:</strong> The bottom floor of the tower served primarily as a storeroom.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Ib. Armory:</strong> The watchtower keepers stowed their extra armor and weapons on this floor.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Ic. Quarters:</strong> The watchtower keepers slept here between shifts.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Id. Rookery</strong>: Communication between the watchtowers was vital during Bonmu’s prime. To facilitate this, each tower maintained a rookery of messenger birds. Ie. Rooftop: The tower keepers used the large brazier and set of warning horns to warn Bonmu of incoming danger. If the characters light a brazier after destroying a watchtower’s undead, the brazier becomes permanently lit and the tower’s keeper can move on to the afterlife.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creatures:</strong> Each of tower hosts a number of spirits. The anguish of their death bound them to their towers, some as ghosts and some as other forms of undead. The spirits can’t leave the tower but can freely move between the tower floors and up to 40 feet directly above the roof. Regardless of the specific undead, the method for releasing a bound keeper is the same: the characters must destroy the spirits, then light the brazier on the tower’s roof. Completing this task puts the spirits at ease and allows them to move on. When the characters destroy a spirit, wisps of the spirit rush up to the brazier and glow faintly within it for a moment before vanishing—a hint from the spirit on how to set them free. A spirit otherwise re-forms 12 hours after their destruction.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Treasure: </strong>For each watchtower spirit the characters permanently destroy, they receive a parting gift as thanks on the tower’s brazier. The gift includes a Bonmuan swapping stone, plus one of the following: +2 greater striking greater flaming wind and fire wheel, a fire jump ring, a pair of hellfire boots, or a major staff of fire.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">I1. Southwestern Watchtower</span></strong><br />This keeper rose as a powerful <strong>poltergeist </strong>and now haunts the armory of this tower</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">I2. Southeastern Watchtower<br /></span></strong>This keeper rose as a powerful <strong>shadow </strong>and now haunts the quarters of this tower.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">I3. Northwestern Watchtower<br /></span></strong>This keeper rose as a powerful <strong>wraith</strong> and now haunts the rookery of this tower.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">I4. Northeastern Watchtower<br /></span></strong>This keeper rose as a <strong>banshee</strong> and now haunts the rooftop of this tower.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>J. Treasure Sites</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Several locations throughout Bonmu feature nothing other than treasures for the characters to find, ranging from abandoned homes to small shrines to nondescript patches of wilderness.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\">J1. </strong> A small chest is buried in the sand, the remnants of a shipwreck several miles out from Bonmu. The chest contains four greater healing potions, a high-grade silver buckler, six oils of mending, a 4th-level scroll of water walk, and a truesight potion.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\">J2. </strong>One of the other teams snagged their phoenix necklace here on the branches of a tall tree while fleeing a dinosaur. They failed to retrieve all their belongings, and now a single silver feather dangles from the branch, free for the taking.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\">J3.</strong> This abandoned magic shop contains four pouches of dust of disappearance, a major staff of illusion, a scroll of blink, three scrolls of chain lightning, a scroll of ethereal jaunt, a scroll of mariner’s curse, a scroll of project image, and a scroll of tongues.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\">J4. </strong> A pair of greater boots of bounding remain in this abandoned bungalow.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\">J5. </strong>A small jade idol shaped like a rising phoenix sits in the center of where four otherwise nondescript game trails intersect. This phoenix idol sells for 500 gp but has a far greater use during the pre-qualifying round. Inscribed on its base, in Hao Jin’s hand, is this: “Give this idol to an enforcer to decline a single match.” After receiving a challenge but before the challenge begins, the characters can simply hand the idol to the attending enforcer to forgo the match without a loss of silver feathers. The challenging team is then prohibited from challenging the characters again for 12 hours.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\">J6.</strong> This small shrine, its features long worn away, holds a candle of truth and 514 gp in various coins, gems, and other offerings in its offering box. </p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\">J7.</strong>Tucked in this riverside foxhole is a fade band, two swan boat feather tokens, and 561 gp in various coins, gems, and other offerings. </p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\">J8.</strong> A messenger’s ring lies among the rubble of this destroyed shrine.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\">J9.</strong> A false floorboard in this abandoned outpost hides three greater elixirs of life, a greater ring of electricity resistance, and a moonlit chain shirt.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\">J10.</strong> A cache buried beneath an ominous pair of dead trees—their tops interwoven to form an “X”— contains 15 emeralds worth 100 gp each.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>K. Enforcer Base</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This stone building once served as the headquarters for Bonmu’s elite guards and now hosts the headquarters for the Ruby Phoenix Tournament’s enforcers. The large structure houses several dozen troops, and at least a few enforcers attend the structure around the clock. A clearly posted sign warns anyone who approaches the building to keep away or face punishment at the hands of the enforcers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creatures: </strong>Teams who don’t heed the warning soon see a quartet of enforcers exit the building to meet them. The enforcers declare a match against the team, putting three of the team’s silver feathers on the line. The characters must accept the wager or be disqualified.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Enforcer Monk</strong></li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Enforcer Mage</strong></li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Enforcer Rogue</strong></li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Enforcer Warrior</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Treasure: </strong>If the characters manage to win the match against the enforcers, the enforcers are duly impressed and grant them a bonus prize of 2,500 gp for their tenacious spirit. They do warn, however, that this is a one-time deal; the next time the characters approach the garrison looking for a fight, the enforcers provide it in even greater numbers but reward no additional treasure.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>L. Lightkeeper's Base</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This is the headquarters for the Lightkeepers, a team of fighters hired by one of Hao Jin’s ancient enemies. They are the player characters’ primary rivals throughout this Adventure Path (though this may not yet be obvious to the characters; refer to the sidebar on page 39 for ideas on how to introduce these rivals). The base remains empty most of the day since the Lightkeepers are out exploring the island, accompanied by their emissary escort. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The Lightkeepers’ escort is a craven middle-aged Tian-Sing man named <strong>Hibomari </strong>(CN male human enforcer 9). Hibomari’s family has connections throughout Goka, which allowed him to secure a spot as a highly paid enforcer on Bonmu, despite his lack of scruples and general spinelessness. Syu Tak-Nwa easily manipulates Hibomari with magic and guile, getting him to look the other way more often than not and even completely disappear on some lengthy but trivial errand whenever it suits her.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If the player characters choose to explore the base, they find very little sign of life. There isn’t much in the way of food, disturbed dust, or even signs of passage in the building—details that are all suspicious enough on their own. Investigating the base turns up a number of other foreboding clues.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">A character using detect magic senses an aura of conjuration magic throughout the base. With a successful DC 35 Arcana or Occultism check, the caster can recognize the aura as a result of powerful teleportation magic. These findings are suspicious but inconclusive. The player characters have no way to know that the ambient conjuration magic is a byproduct of the frequent plane shift spells used by Syndara the Sculptor—the Lightkeepers’ secret sponsor—to recall the Lightkeepers to his plane and return them to Bonmu.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>M. Tamikan's Lair</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">One of the more powerful predators on Bonmu has laired in the southern swamp since before the island’s original inhabitants fled: a unique kongamato that the Bonmuan locals dubbed Tamikan. While Tamikan normally holds free reign over the region, she’s grown irritable with the introduction of so many visitors to her island. Tamikan now looks to attack anyone who comes near her lair.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The first time the characters travel through this hex, Tamikan has a 20% chance of noticing them. If she does, the kongamato swoops down after the intruders, using a Wailing Dive in an attempt to scare them off. Tamikan doesn’t give chase if her targets flee, but every time after this initial encounter that the characters travel through the hex, the odds are greater that Tamikan spots them and ultimately attacks. The likelihood increases to 50%, then 75%, and is finally guaranteed on the fourth trip.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creature: </strong>Tamikan is more powerful than a typical kongamato. She starts combat with her Sonic Screech attack, following it up with a Wailing Dive. Tamikan makes use of hit-and-run tactics to harass her prey and soften them up before going for the kill on an obviously smaller or weaker individual. Tamikan retreats to her lair if reduced to 75 Hit Points, and she surrenders if reduced to 50 Hit Points within her home, taking flight for another island.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Tamikan </strong>(female kongamato)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Treasure: </strong>Tamikan’s lair holds a number of treasures she’s collected from prey over the years, including a transparent elemental gem, four barkskin potions, a pair of boots of speed, a major staff of healing, a spined shield, a swift block cabochon, a vanishing coin, 134 gp, 289 sp, and 1,922 cp.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>N. Spotfoot Village</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This swampy village plays home to the Spotfoots, a small group of boggards that migrated from a neighboring island just a few decades ago. The boggards used up most of their first island’s resources and eradicated its natural life. Without means to support themselves, they made the dangerous trek across the sea and landed in Bonmu. The island’s greater abundance of resources— and the occasional culling from a wandering predator— has kept their population stable.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The village is relatively unremarkable. It consists of a few scattered mud huts dispersed throughout the thick marsh and a large open area in the center of the village dedicated to worship. See the map on page 44.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Creatures: The boggard villagers traveled to Bonmu on the backs of their two deities, a mated pair of mogobos named Ganmoji and Roommon. The draconic, toadlike mogobos are cruel creatures that revel in the Spotfoots’ worship. It was their idea to journey to Bonmu, once the mobogos ruined their former home’s ecosystem. Now, Ganmoji and Roommon enjoy a comfortable life as idols, content to laze around the swamp and let their boggard sycophants bring them tasty animals from hunts. The mobogos do occasionally fend off predators who stumble into the swamp, but otherwise show little care for their new home or their worshippers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If the player characters visit the village, the mobogos demand they depart at once, then order their loyal boggard servants to hunt down the invaders and bring back their heads as a show of piety. The boggards spring into action, though they likely pose no challenge for the player characters. If the characters refuse to leave their village or question the mobogos’ authority, the “gods” decide to take matters into their own hands.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">They move to opposite ends of the village, use their tongues to separate the player characters and keep them apart with their innate magic. Regeneration makes the mobogos relatively fearless, though they immediately change their minds once they take acid, cold, or fire damage. If one of them dies, the other attempts to flee once reduced to fewer than 30 Hit Points, abandoning the boggards and Bonmu forever. Without their deities, the Spotfoots fall to in-fighting and likely treat the characters with fearful awe.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Ganmoji and Roommon </strong>(elite mobogos)</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Spotfoot Swampseer </strong>(boggard swampseer)</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>6 Spotfoot Warriors </strong>(boggard warriors)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Hazards: </strong>The Spotfoot village lies deep within a Bonmu swamp and moving through the swamp is no easy chore. A shallow bog surrounds the entire village. The bog is difficult terrain.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Treasure: </strong>The boggards keep several treasures in their village. Searching the huts turns up an adult green dragon’s breath potion, a bleeding spines snare, two bomb snares, a greater coyote cloak, four vials of giant wasp venom, and four vials of malyass root paste.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>O. Jaiban's Lair</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This rocky cliffside lair (map on page 44) plays home to another legendary beast of Bonmu.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creature: </strong>An enormous beast of heretofore-unknown species made its way to Bonmu centuries ago during the time between the Taumatan and Bonmuan occupations. When the first Tian-Sing settlers arrived on Bonmu, they encountered the incredible monster and nearly lost their lives to its fury. The settlers named the creature Jaiban and decided to leave its territory alone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Jaiban continues its relatively quiet life in its lair, swimming out to sea to feed. If the characters intrude on this lair, there is a 25% chance Jaiban is out hunting; it otherwise spends all its time here. Highly irritable and territorial, Jaiban attacks at the first sign of intruders. It fights to the death.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Jaiban</strong>, Legendary beast of Bonmu</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>P. Mount Haminabu</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This location is the site for the final events of the qualifying round. It is detailed in Chapter 3.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Q. Broken Eggshell</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">An enormous broken eggshell lies on this small beach cove abutting Bonmu’s largest coral reef. The shell is as large as a house and over a foot thick. The shell belongs to the infant child of King Mogaru, a legendary kaiju from the Valashmai Jungle. Hao Jin’s rival Syndara stole the egg from Mogaru in an attempt to lure Mogaru toward Goka during the Ruby Phoenix Tournament (see the next adventure, “Ready? Fight!”, for this development), and when it suddenly hatched, Syndara kept the fledgling kaiju in his care, named it Moku, and haphazardly abandoned its shell here.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Few people (if any) have seen a kaiju egg, so at first glance it’s easy to mistake it for the shell of an especially large bird or dinosaur. By succeeding at one or more of the following checks (all DC 35), a character might glean a bit more info about the strange encasing. On a critical success, the character learns the details enclosed in parentheses.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Occultism: </strong>The shell is marked by strange veins of seafloor sand. (The egg came from the bottom of the ocean, where benthic horrors and unfathomably powerful monsters reign, rather than anywhere on land.)</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Nature: </strong>The egg’s shape and structure indicate that it most likely belonged to a reptilian creature. (The creature was a dinosaur, but obviously no typical specimen.)</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Survival: </strong>There are no signs of the hatched creature nearby—footprints or otherwise. (The creature emerged from the shell elsewhere and the egg was placed here later.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">For now, the broken egg will remain a mystery, but the characters will get to see the effects of kidnapping a young kaiju and have a chance to meet Moku in this Adventure Path’s subsequent adventures.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>R. Abandoned Prison</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Earning a place in the Ruby Phoenix Tournament is difficult. The Trembling Meteors, a team hailing from Avistan, learned this lesson all too quickly after their first defeat on Bonmu. Rather than continue facing other teams, the Trembling Meteors decided to create their own silver feathers and earn their place in the tournament with ease. After splitting up in the jungle to lose their emissary, they rendezvoused back at this old underground prison complex to begin their new plan. The team’s leader, Pomtaris, used her skillful hands and specialized tools to replicate the silver feathers. Unbeknownst to Pomtaris, though, the feathers are specifically attuned to the phoenix necklaces to confirm entry in the tournament. Counterfeit feathers simply won’t work.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The abandoned prison is a relic from the days of Taumata; Bonmu’s subsequent occupiers weren’t sure they wanted to incorporate such a cruel structure into their culture and left it alone. Magical torches along the stone walls fill all of the rooms with bright light, which fades to dim light after sunset. The ceiling rises to a height of 20 feet in all rooms. Doors in the prison are unlocked unless otherwise noted. Page 44 shows a map of the prison.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">R1. Entrance</span><br /></strong>The prison’s entryway contains a large statue of a forgotten Taumatan god holding a breadfruit over its head as if in ceremony. A stone double door leads in and out of the prison from here.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">R2. Registration</span><br /></strong>Here, offenders were stripped of any remaining belongings and registered in the prison’s logs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">R3. Guard Quarters</span><br /></strong>A few guards posted in this now-empty room watched the lobby.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">R4. Storage</span><br /></strong>Guards stored casks of water, baskets of fruit, and packages of meat in this corner room.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:17.5px\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">R5. Meeting Room</span><br /></strong></span>Prisoners who wished to speak with a priest would do so here. A ceremonial knife made of black lava rock lies forgotten in the corner.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">R6. Hall</span><br /></strong>The prison’s main hall looped around the complex and allowed access to each of the cell rooms.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creatures:</strong> Two iron golems remain here despite this prison’s centuries of abandonment, ever vigilant to arrest would-be escapees. The golems stand at silent attention by the doorway and immediately move to intercept and attack anyone who tries to pass them, giving chase throughout the temple, but never outside. </p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>2 Iron Golems</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">R7. Northern Cells</span><br /></strong>High-profile prisoners were given their own spacious stone cells. A sturdy iron door bars entry to each cell. All the northern cells are empty except for bones, pebbles, and rotted fibers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"font-size:17.5px\"><strong>R8. Southern Cells</strong></span></span><br />The majority of prisoners resided in tightly packed quarters on this side of the prison. Each iron door is locked, requiring two successful DC 33 checks to Pick the Lock. Any creature without at least a master proficiency in Thievery automatically fails their attempts to unlock a cell.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Treasure: </strong>Four cells still contain belongings of value. One has a greater crafter’s eyepiece. Another has a 3rd-level wand of manifold missiles and a 5th-level wand of widening. The third cell holds an explorer’s yurt. The final cell contains a +2 striking corrosive dagger.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\">R9. Work Floor</strong></span><br />Prison guards oversaw the prisoners’ forced labor in this large workspace. Authorities forced the most talented prisoners to craft statues of various gods as well as other simple works of art, while the rest of the prisoners were taken outside to hunt dangerous game.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Pomtaris created the counterfeit silver feathers here, leaving many of her tools and failed attempts scattered across the floor. Anyone who takes more than a few moments to look around the room immediately realizes what the Trembling Meteors were up to.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creatures: </strong>Two of the Trembling Meteors are here, Pomtaris and her wife, Tromtil. The two are relaxing after Pomtaris’s quick work creating the silver feathers. If the player characters managed to slip past the golems, Pomtaris and Tromtil are rejoicing in song as they enjoy some brandy. If the characters fought the golems, the sounds of combat alerted the two fighters, and they’ve asked their teammates (area <strong>R11</strong>) to join them in this room. Without their ward, Pomtaris and her friends feel emboldened to attack the player characters outright rather than challenge them to a match, and they conspire to loot the characters’ silver feathers off their bodies once they’ve dispatched them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:17.5px\"><strong>Pomtaris</strong> (female human weapon master)</span></li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:17.5px\"><strong>Tromtil </strong>(female human mage of many styles)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Treasure: </strong>Pomtaris holds her team’s 2 legitimate silver feathers, which Ingdani authorizes the player characters to claim for themselves if they defeat the despicable Trembling Meteors in combat. Afterward, Ingdani reports Pomtaris and her friends to the enforcers on duty at the nearest sanctioned fighting site.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\">R10. Head Guard’s Office</strong></span> <br />The head guard of the prison kept this office for their work. Treasure: The desk in the office contains a greater skeleton key, a ring of lies, slates of distant letters, and a predictable silver piece.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\">R11. Lounge</strong></span> <br />The prison guards and priest used this lounge as a breakroom.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creatures: </strong>The two other Trembling Meteors are relaxing here, though they might have moved to the work floor as noted above (area R9). Harbis and Lown are content to let Pomtaris take care of the silver feather issue, but if the player characters enter here, the two jump to their feet to fight.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong style=\"font-size:17.5px\">Harbis and Lown</strong><span style=\"font-size:17.5px\"> (human agile warriors)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong style=\"font-size:1.25em\">R12. Vault</strong></span><br />On an initial glance, this part of the hallway appears to just be a wall. The guards had a permanent illusion placed here to hide the door to the prison’s vault of seized goods. The Trembling Meteors were unable to disbelieve the illusion, so they think there’s nothing else of value in the prison.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">When the player characters approach this wall, attempt a secret DC 33 Will save to disbelieve for each character. On a success, they notice the wall fade to a translucent image cloaking the vault door. Alternatively, a character who Seeks in the area with a successful DC 35 Perception check notices the vault door peeking out slightly beyond the illusion. The guards didn’t properly close the vault door when they fled the prison and it remains slightly ajar even today. Noticing the door causes that character to automatically disbelieve the illusion. As a result, the characters can enter freely and collect the treasure within.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Treasure: </strong>Within the vault, the characters find alchemist’s goggles, a greater staff of enchantment, a rod of wonder, two vials of shadow essence, a pouch of 20 rubies worth 40 gp each, 1,408 gp, 6,720 sp, and 3,055 cp.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>S. Empty Pond</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The water in this pond appears to have been mysteriously drained all at once. Dozens of fish flop about in the muddy, 30-foot pit it left behind. A large island juts up from its center.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creature: </strong>The island is, in fact, a camouflaged berberoka—a monster that can swallow up entire ponds and even lakes to attract curious prey. This berberoka has taken to drinking this pond when it hears teams of competitors nearby; it has ignobly eaten two such teams already, adorning its back with their belongings in the hopes of luring in more prey.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">When the characters arrive here, they see the empty pond and the island, which is actually the berberoka in disguise. If at least one character approaches the berberoka, it regurgitates the water in its belly to knock them over, then attacks. The berberoka flees if reduced to fewer than 50 Hit Points.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:17.5px\"><strong>Berberoka</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Treasure: </strong>The berberoka’s belongings, which it took from competitors that it ate, include a pair of armbands of athleticism, a golden lions wondrous figurine, a greater striking rune, and a broken phoenix necklace carrying a single intact silver feather.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>T. Manananggal Village</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This small settlement of thatched huts along the western slopes of Mount Haminabu bears obvious signs of life. Human tracks scatter about, alongside scraps of meat and small bones from previous meals. A character can also recognize some odd discarded salves (a mixture of coconut oil, chicken dung, and entrails) with a successful DC 32 Survival check. With a successful DC 28 Bonmu Lore or other relevant skill check to Recall Knowledge, a character can identify these components as common to the profane rituals of manananggals.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creatures: </strong>The village is in fact home to several manananggals, terrible undead that resemble humans during the day. At night, the top halves of their bodies tear away and grow wings, and the grotesque predators fly off and attack the inhabitants of neighboring islands. These manananggals arrived on Bonmu several years ago and took residence in this abandoned village. The thick jungle canopy protects them from direct sunlight, allowing the manananggals to walk around their home without concern. At night, they launch into the sky, taking advantage of Bonmu’s proximity to other islands to hunt for food before returning here at sunrise.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">When the characters arrive here, they likely see the manananggals around the village in their full-body forms, unless they arrive between sunset and sunrise, when the village is empty. The manananggals act especially abrasive in hopes of convincing the characters to leave. If they do, the manananggals follow them in secret and attack when they rest for the night. If the characters don’t leave, the manananggals intentionally separate from their bodies to attack. The manananggals fight to the death to defend their home.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-size:17.5px\"><strong>6 Elite Manananggals</strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p>","img":null,"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wgjTDLixUZ8YXqS9":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"type":"base","scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.hRkhdlbXzuCBr9vf"},"cf":{"id":"temp_gbhn0a6fdhk"}}}
{"_id":"spFZ1M6lXWkyS5xn","name":"Meeting Tino's Toughest","content":"<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-1.tkZammVVCVNyF21E]{Setting Out}</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">As soon as the player characters start their trip toward the temple of Irori (but before they make it very far), another team runs up and hails them. This team is Tino’s Toughest. Tino and his pals are an amicable lot, and the player characters will get to know them well throughout the Adventure Path. (More details about Tino’s Toughest can be found in “Ruby Phoenix Fighting Roster” on page 66.) For now, Tino introduces himself and his team, then explains that he overheard that the characters are headed to the temple of Irori. Tino and his team are staying in the library of Gruhastha, half a mile from the temple, and they’re all eager to meet their island neighbors.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Tino’s Toughest might seem a motley bunch at first glance. Tino, though exhibiting youthful exuberance and a finely honed body with a fashionable tattoo of the Master’s Rebus on his chest, is already into his middle years and has seen his fair share of triumphs and tragedies. Ji-yook is coy and aloof, always promising that she’ll strike out on her own after one last adventure, but she inevitably sticks with her friends. Takatorra is Tino’s best friend since childhood, and Tino has loyally helped Takatorra—whose lengthy search for self-realization and rare sweets don’t hinder their mastery of swordplay—through countless challenges both existential and confectionary. Yabin “the Just” is the most stoic of the lot, though even the slightest mention of anything dragon-related is enough to get the sorcerer babbling about his favorite topic of study.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Tino and his team see the Ruby Phoenix Tournament as an opportunity to improve their fighting skills. “We’ve met a lot of people on our adventures,” Tino says, “but there’s always more to learn. When we got word we were invited to take part in the Ruby Phoenix Tournament, we leapt at the chance to travel to a new place and test our strength against worthy opponents. It would be quite a thing to earn one of Hao Jin’s great treasures… but as long as we’re having fun and making memories, I don’t think any of us would regret losing the tournament!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Tino suggests that the party and his team engage in a friendly sparring match. If the player characters seem reluctant, Tino assures them that the fight will only be a friendly match, with no intent for anyone to get hurt. Tino doesn’t pressure the characters further if they remain unsure, and he keeps his offer of a casual bout open for the remainder of the time on Bonmu.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If the characters agree to the fight, Tino offers them the chance to choose the location for the match. The characters can choose any relatively open area; any of the fighting sites in Chapter 2 or the map on the rear inside cover are particularly suitable.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Toughest Tactics: </strong>Tino’s Toughest have adventured together for many years and have honed their fighting tactics to complement one another’s strengths. Tino uses his Retributive Strike to defend Takatorra as the two focus on a single target at a time. Ji-yook springs around the battlefield attacking back-row combatants like archers and spellcasters, and she uses her Pinning Shot to keep similarly mobile foes in place. Yabin keeps his distance, using his spells to confound opponents, control the arena, and enhance his allies’ abilities. The team graciously surrenders if two or more of their members are knocked unconscious or if all of them are reduced to fewer than 50 Hit Points.</p>\n<ul style=\"text-align:justify\">\n<li><strong>Tino (Level 9)</strong>, Perception</li>\n<li><strong>Ji-yook (level 9)</strong>, Perception</li>\n<li><strong>Takatorra (Level 9)</strong>, Perception</li>\n<li><strong>Yabin the Just (Level 9)</strong>, Perception</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Prize:</strong> If the player characters defeat Tino’s Toughest, Tino thanks them for an enjoyable bout and gives them a <em>wand of death ward </em>as thanks. Whether or not the party fights Tino’s team, Tino also gifts the characters two <em>ghost touch </em>weapon runes, saying with a wink, “I’ve heard this island is covered in undead. I’d hate for ghosts to get the better of you before we have a chance to fight again in the tournament.” Tino also offers to use his Medicine skills and magic to heal the characters. </p>","img":"","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wgjTDLixUZ8YXqS9":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"},"cf":{"id":"temp_h9jf0p7uwu","color":"#000000"}}}
{"_id":"tkZammVVCVNyF21E","name":"Setting Out","content":"<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-1.4cZGWFracfL74Ge0]{Chapter 1: Welcome to Danger Island}</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The player characters’ escort is a monk named <strong>Ingdani </strong>(LN female Tian-Sing ghost eater 13). Ingdani descends from one of the Tian-Sing families who fled Bonmu to escape the devastating kaiju attack, and she knows much about the island from the second-hand accounts of her parents and grandparents. This, in addition to her combat proficiency, is partially why Emissary Nuo selected her as an attendant.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Ingdani informs the party that their residence will be at a temple of Irori roughly a third of a mile from the docks. She explains that as the team’s escort, she will accompany them during their stay on the island, answering any questions they have and helping in what limited ways she can.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Archetype Teacher: </strong>Ingdani is an invaluable source of information for the player characters. She is well-versed in the legend of Hao Jin and the history of the Ruby Phoenix Tournament. She is also quite skilled in the unique Minatan martial arts tradition called ghost eating, which she is willing to teach the characters. Ingdani doesn’t offer to teach these techniques immediately, however; first, she wants to see the characters take an honest crack at establishing their base at the abandoned temple of Irori (page 12). Once the characters claim their phoenix necklace (page 75) from the temple, Ingdani teaches them what she knows, granting them access to the ghost eater archetype on page 79. (If your players are enthusiastic to take this archetype, consider bending the usual downtime rules so characters can retrain in a matter of hours rather than weeks.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Ingdani adheres to her strict orders to not help any contenders with any combat while on Bonmu, but she defends herself if necessary. If you need to include Ingdani in combat, use the stat block for the ki adept on page 24 to represent her.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Once the characters are ready to go, Ingdani leads them toward the temple where they’ll be staying. Along the way, she points out the following specific sites that can be seen from the docks.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Ruins Arena: </strong>This arena is the closest designated fighting site to the temple of Irori. It is noted as location C on the map on the inside front cover, in the same hex as the temple of Irori (area A). The player characters are free to accept challenges at the temple, once they have claimed the residence, but can also move any challenges to the ruins arena if they so wish.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Stone Market: </strong>The next site Ingdani points out is a set of small stone shacks at area E. Each of these buildings is magically connected to a tournament-operated stall in the Neverending Market in Goka, allowing competitors to purchase any common goods and equipment during their time on Bonmu. The Stone Market is a hot spot of activity; any time the player characters come here, there is a 25% chance they run into another fighting team looking for a match.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Transport Tower: </strong>Finally, Ingdani notes a stone tower looming over the treetops half a mile north of the temple of Irori, at area D1. She explains that the tower is one of five located around Bonmu. These towers are all connected by teleportation magic and allow for quick transport around the island. The towers are considered safe sites; any attempts to fight or declare a match within them results in instant disqualification.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-1.DGNkYB8rGW1pWb0i]{Danger Island Rules}</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-1.spFZ1M6lXWkyS5xn]{Meeting Tino's Toughest}</li>\n</ul>","img":"","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wgjTDLixUZ8YXqS9":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"},"cf":{"id":"temp_0qowe1ymurfh","color":"#000000"}}}

They can spend whatever’s left of their first day on Bonmu however they see fit. If they aren’t yet 12th level, this is the perfect time to strike out into Bonmu and face a few of the island’s dangers, clearing the way for later and earning some valuable experience (see the Scaling Encounters sidebar on page 24). They can also use this time to acquire equipment from the Stone Market. Finally, contenders can simply wander Bonmu to learn the layout of the island, meet some of their fellow competitors, and strategize for the events of the following days. Refer to the rules starting on page 26 to calculate travel times and distances.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">An hour before sunset on the pre-qualifier’s first day, a pair of enforcers communicate with the characters via their phoenix necklace, directing the party to meet with them outside the temple of Irori. The enforcers request that the contenders present their phoenix necklace and 3 silver feathers, then remind the characters that the qualifying round begins at sunrise before leaving.</p>\n<section class=\"readaloud\">\n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Chapter 2 Synopsis</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The Ruby Phoenix Tournament’s pre-qualifier begins in earnest.

The player characters explore Bonmu, challenge other teams to matches, encounter dangerous creatures, discover lost ruins, and more. At the end of the second day, the characters defend themselves and their base from a small army of powerful constructs. </p>\n</section>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-1.Vil4QMavhgXM3XKS]{Base Combatants}</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-1.gcdQI2XFVh0gsfeH]{Earning Feathers}</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-1.jZ4bK0gnAhYMZ3Jt]{Traveling on Bonmu}</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-1.rkBya0qYaHb3IyO8]{Bonmu Locations}</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-1.JzKJaTd3eFQF5sUQ]{Wandering Teams}</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-1.lbnulKMw3FhslrVP]{Events}</li>\n</ul>","img":"","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wgjTDLixUZ8YXqS9":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"}}}

Most teams opt for as few fighters as possible, since the winners must split their prize evenly, but Hana’s Hundreds favored quantity over quality when it came to their own team, reasoning that only a few of them will likely make it to the final bouts uninjured. Regardless of their actual numbers, Hana’s Hundreds have found a technique that works pretty well for them: they swarm and overwhelm opponents using their large numbers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">When the team finds the player characters, they wager two of their silver feathers for the match. In combat, they form a chaotic mass of screams and steel. Hana’s Hundreds attempt to attack multiple foes at once.

Each sister studied at the Houses of Perfection in Jalmeray and learned to master a specific element to include with their techniques. Manyala practiced her control over fire at the Monastery of Unblinking Flame, while Rijana underwent tutelage in the Monastery of Unbreaking Waves to learn control over ice.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The twins bring the enforcers who visited the temple an hour earlier and officially declare their challenge against the characters just as the sun rises. They wager two of their silver feathers for the match. The adventure assumes the characters have the match at the temple of Irori, though they are free to move it to a nearby fighting site if they prefer.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In combat, the sisters stay close together to make it more difficult to flank them. They make liberal use of their ki blast spell and their Channel Element abilities. Manyala surrenders if reduced to fewer than 50 Hit Points, but Rijana continues to fight until knocked unconscious or reduced to 0 Hit Points.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Manyala and Rijana Ahmoza</strong> (female Vudran weak ki adepts)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>New Feat: </strong>If the player characters win the match, Manyala and Rijana are genuinely impressed by the party’s skill. In addition to the reward for winning the match, they offer to teach the characters one of their powerful techniques. This process requires 1 hour and 2 hexploration activities but earns the party access to the Entwined Energy Ki feat (page 74).</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Event 2: Challenge of the Enforcers</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Sometime after the characters collect 5 silver feathers, they catch the attention of a group of tournament enforcers. The group’s leader, a hobgoblin monk by the name of Gomwai, attended the last Ruby Phoenix Tournament as a pawn of the Golden League, a notorious Gokan crime syndicate, and even made it to the final round before ultimately losing to the champions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Gomwai’s loss gave him an opportunity for significant self-reflection and a reassessment of his values. He felt great shame for his involvement with the Golden League and chose to step away from his criminal connections to become a mercenary bodyguard for important business leaders in Goka. When the church of Abadar started recruiting staff for this year’s tournament, Gomwai leapt at the opportunity, wishing to give back to the tournament that had done so much for him. Gomwai earned a place as an enforcer, and he leads a small group of less experienced fighters-turned-enforcers in the pre-qualifier.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Now, Gomwai has received orders from Koto Zekora, the enforcer leader, to thin out some of the silver feathers. The player characters happen to be the nearest team when Gomwai gets his orders.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creatures: </strong>Gomwai and his squad of enforcers find the characters and challenge them to a match for 2 silver feathers. The match itself has no additional wrinkles and is a simple fight. Gomwai uses Flurry of Blows to Trip as many targets as possible, then lets the other enforcers come in and take advantage of the opening. If the characters take out two members of the squad, the remaining enforcer surrenders and declares the player characters the match’s winners.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>2 Enforcers</strong></li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Gomwai </strong>(male hobgoblin tournament enforcer)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Prize:</strong> If the player characters win the challenge, Gomwai rewards them with 1,500 gp in addition to the standard 500 gp they earn for winning the match. In addition, Gomwai presents them with a phoenix idol in the shape of a rising phoenix. The characters can sell this idol or use it to turn down a match as noted in area <strong>J5 </strong>(page 37).</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Event 3: The Spiteful Cauthooj</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Among the many creatures already living on Bonmu, one of the most intelligent is an old cauthooj who has lived on the island for over a century. During that time, the cauthooj enjoyed easy access to food and plenty of small treasures on Bonmu. When the tournament staff started making preparations on the island, they piqued the cauthooj’s interest. Once the prequalifying round began in earnest, the cauthooj saw an opportunity to snag more baubles and treasures from the new arrivals.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The cauthooj likes to sneak up on resting contenders and steal small trinkets like gems or even silver feathers. This event can occur any time the player characters are exploring, resting between fights, or getting their bearings.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creature:</strong> The old cauthooj attempts to sneak up on the characters, using Stealth for its initiative. It attempts to walk into the group, grab the nearest trinket, and run away. If the cauthooj acts first in initiative, it catches the characters unawares. In this case, the characters are slowed 1 for the first round of combat. The cauthooj attempts to take the characters’ phoenix necklace first and foremost.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If the cauthooj manages to slip away with an item, the characters can attempt to Track the cauthooj and reclaim their lost bauble. Doing so requires a successful DC 32 Survival check. Once the characters are on the hunt, they can find the cauthooj after following the trail for 10 minutes. The cauthooj tries to run away from combat again, requiring the characters to Track the cauthooj again if it escapes. This continues until the third time the characters Track it. Tired of running, the cauthooj stands its ground to fight. If the cauthooj is reduced to fewer than 50 Hit Points, it drops its treasures as a distraction and runs away for good. The cauthooj also withdraws if the player characters are able to reclaim their stolen item.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Elder Cauthooj</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Treasure: The cauthooj sees all of Bonmu as its domain and thus doesn’t keep a lair of any sort. Instead, it uses a small bag found during its initial days on the island to carry all of its treasures. The cauthooj keeps the bag around its neck and places any baubles it picks up inside.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If the characters are able to claim the bag, they find a fair amount of junk but also a few true treasures, including a balisse feather; a piece of dispelling silver; a light brown elemental gem; an eye of apprehension; a glowing, thin glass rod which turns out to be a wand of crackling lightning (6th level; Advanced Player’s Guide 265); a runestone that glows with faint, crimson light due to its greater flaming rune; and a greater ring of cold resistance.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Event 4: A Desperate Struggle</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Late in the day, a different team finds the characters and begins a new match.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creatures: </strong>This team is a group of spellcasters from Avistan known as the Glowing Embers. While they’re accomplished wizards, they were not prepared for the rigors of the qualifying round. Namely, their inexperience with close-quarters combat led them to be overwhelmed by opponents able to quickly close the gap on them on the battlefield.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The Glowing Embers wager their 1 remaining silver feather against the player characters. They start the match strong, breaking up the battlefield with areas of black tentacles, but after 3 rounds the fatigue of the day’s earlier events sets in. All their members become clumsy 1 and enfeebled 1 for the remainder of the match.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If the player characters win, the Glowing Embers offer them a half-spirited congratulations before following the enforcers toward the docks to leave the island.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>4 Glowing Embers Members </strong>(human weak mage of many styles)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Event 5: Saving the Cloud Jesters</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Just as the characters begin to wind down for the day, they get swept up in another team’s potentially deadly mistake.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creatures: </strong>A team of adventurers named the Cloud Jesters decided to explore a small, hidden tomb. During their exploration, they activated several stone golems guarding the tomb. While the Jesters managed to hold the sentries off for a time, they recognized a losing battle and chose to run away.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The player characters happen to pass by at the right moment to hear the Cloud Jesters screaming for help as they flee the tomb. If the characters decide to help, they can follow the screams to find the Cloud Jesters several hundred feet away. Injured from the fight, most of the Cloud Jesters have collapsed by the time the characters find them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The stone golems are attempting to reclaim a stolen treasure from the Cloud Jesters but will turn on the characters if attacked by them. The Cloud Jesters are too injured to aid in the fight.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Stone Golems</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Treasure:</strong> If the characters destroy the golems and save the Cloud Jesters, the team offers their sincerest thanks and gives them the frost brand they stole from the tomb as a reward, believing the sword to have been too much trouble to be worth keeping anyway.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If the characters take longer than 10 minutes to come find the source of the screams, the stone golems have already finished off the Cloud Jesters and left with the stolen weapon. There’s no sign of the golems anywhere, and only the corpses of the Cloud Jesters remain. The characters can claim the Cloud Jesters’ equipment if they wish, as there are no enforcers around to stop them. The Cloud Jesters were an agile warrior, archery specialist, mage of many styles, and weapon master (pages 23–25) and have the appropriate equipment. In addition, the Cloud Jester’s leader carries the team’s two remaining silver feathers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p>","img":"","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wgjTDLixUZ8YXqS9":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"type":"base","scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.hRkhdlbXzuCBr9vf"},"cf":{"id":"temp_sb55ol5wixk"}}}

Each sister studied at the Houses of Perfection in Jalmeray and learned to master a specific element to include with their techniques. Manyala practiced her control over fire at the Monastery of Unblinking Flame, while Rijana underwent tutelage in the Monastery of Unbreaking Waves to learn control over ice.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The twins bring the enforcers who visited the temple an hour earlier and officially declare their challenge against the characters just as the sun rises. They wager two of their silver feathers for the match. The adventure assumes the characters have the match at the temple of Irori, though they are free to move it to a nearby fighting site if they prefer.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In combat, the sisters stay close together to make it more difficult to flank them. They make liberal use of their ki blast spell and their Channel Element abilities. Manyala surrenders if reduced to fewer than 50 Hit Points, but Rijana continues to fight until knocked unconscious or reduced to 0 Hit Points.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Manyala and Rijana Ahmoza</strong> (female Vudran weak ki adepts)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>New Feat: </strong>If the player characters win the match, Manyala and Rijana are genuinely impressed by the party’s skill. In addition to the reward for winning the match, they offer to teach the characters one of their powerful techniques. This process requires 1 hour and 2 hexploration activities but earns the party access to the Entwined Energy Ki feat (page 74).</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Event 2: Challenge of the Enforcers</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Sometime after the characters collect 5 silver feathers, they catch the attention of a group of tournament enforcers. The group’s leader, a hobgoblin monk by the name of Gomwai, attended the last Ruby Phoenix Tournament as a pawn of the Golden League, a notorious Gokan crime syndicate, and even made it to the final round before ultimately losing to the champions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Gomwai’s loss gave him an opportunity for significant self-reflection and a reassessment of his values. He felt great shame for his involvement with the Golden League and chose to step away from his criminal connections to become a mercenary bodyguard for important business leaders in Goka. When the church of Abadar started recruiting staff for this year’s tournament, Gomwai leapt at the opportunity, wishing to give back to the tournament that had done so much for him. Gomwai earned a place as an enforcer, and he leads a small group of less experienced fighters-turned-enforcers in the pre-qualifier.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Now, Gomwai has received orders from Koto Zekora, the enforcer leader, to thin out some of the silver feathers. The player characters happen to be the nearest team when Gomwai gets his orders.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creatures: </strong>Gomwai and his squad of enforcers find the characters and challenge them to a match for 2 silver feathers. The match itself has no additional wrinkles and is a simple fight. Gomwai uses Flurry of Blows to Trip as many targets as possible, then lets the other enforcers come in and take advantage of the opening. If the characters take out two members of the squad, the remaining enforcer surrenders and declares the player characters the match’s winners.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>2 Enforcers</strong></li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Gomwai </strong>(male hobgoblin tournament enforcer)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Prize:</strong> If the player characters win the challenge, Gomwai rewards them with 1,500 gp in addition to the standard 500 gp they earn for winning the match. In addition, Gomwai presents them with a phoenix idol in the shape of a rising phoenix. The characters can sell this idol or use it to turn down a match as noted in area <strong>J5 </strong>(page 37).</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Event 3: The Spiteful Cauthooj</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Among the many creatures already living on Bonmu, one of the most intelligent is an old cauthooj who has lived on the island for over a century. During that time, the cauthooj enjoyed easy access to food and plenty of small treasures on Bonmu. When the tournament staff started making preparations on the island, they piqued the cauthooj’s interest. Once the prequalifying round began in earnest, the cauthooj saw an opportunity to snag more baubles and treasures from the new arrivals.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The cauthooj likes to sneak up on resting contenders and steal small trinkets like gems or even silver feathers. This event can occur any time the player characters are exploring, resting between fights, or getting their bearings.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creature:</strong> The old cauthooj attempts to sneak up on the characters, using Stealth for its initiative. It attempts to walk into the group, grab the nearest trinket, and run away. If the cauthooj acts first in initiative, it catches the characters unawares. In this case, the characters are slowed 1 for the first round of combat. The cauthooj attempts to take the characters’ phoenix necklace first and foremost.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If the cauthooj manages to slip away with an item, the characters can attempt to Track the cauthooj and reclaim their lost bauble. Doing so requires a successful DC 32 Survival check. Once the characters are on the hunt, they can find the cauthooj after following the trail for 10 minutes. The cauthooj tries to run away from combat again, requiring the characters to Track the cauthooj again if it escapes. This continues until the third time the characters Track it. Tired of running, the cauthooj stands its ground to fight. If the cauthooj is reduced to fewer than 50 Hit Points, it drops its treasures as a distraction and runs away for good. The cauthooj also withdraws if the player characters are able to reclaim their stolen item.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Elder Cauthooj</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Treasure: The cauthooj sees all of Bonmu as its domain and thus doesn’t keep a lair of any sort. Instead, it uses a small bag found during its initial days on the island to carry all of its treasures. The cauthooj keeps the bag around its neck and places any baubles it picks up inside.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If the characters are able to claim the bag, they find a fair amount of junk but also a few true treasures, including a balisse feather; a piece of dispelling silver; a light brown elemental gem; an eye of apprehension; a glowing, thin glass rod which turns out to be a wand of crackling lightning (6th level; Advanced Player’s Guide 265); a runestone that glows with faint, crimson light due to its greater flaming rune; and a greater ring of cold resistance.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Event 4: A Desperate Struggle</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Late in the day, a different team finds the characters and begins a new match.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creatures: </strong>This team is a group of spellcasters from Avistan known as the Glowing Embers.

There are a total of 8 silver feathers up for grabs around Bonmu; the first teams to reach them can claim them. Any teams that want the feathers must reach the nearest fighting site on a first come, first rewarded basis. Unfortunately for the teams, it’s not actually as simple as that. In the spirit of competition, the enforcers wait to award the silver feathers until there are at least two teams at a fighting site so that they can partake in a physical non-combat challenge to win the feather</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">To partake in the challenge, the characters must reach a fighting site (area C) within 3 hours of the challenge decree. Once the characters have attempted three challenges or by 3 p.m., whichever comes first, all the remaining feathers have been taken and this event ends</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">There are three different types of challenges. These challenges can start at any fighting site, but do not use the map of the fighting site. Rather, run these challenges “theater of the mind” style or devise your own simple map.

Magic and subterfuge are perfectly viable tactics in this event. When the winner of a challenge is unclear, the enforcer makes the final call. Contestants may attack each other if they wish, but this fighting is not considered an official match and so they cannot wager feathers.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The enforcer on duty can provide basic equipment to either team such as ropes, poles, and hooks, which both teams are encouraged to use if needed. In general, as always, err on the side of your players and reward creative solutions. (If your players would rather roll checks, use very easy, average, and very hard DCs for their level as appropriate.)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Banana Challenge: </strong>The enforcer has hidden 10 red bananas in the jungle’s underbrush. Red bananas are a relatively common plant on Bonmu, but the enforcers have removed all such plants from the surrounding 200-foot radius. The team with the most red bananas at the end of 2 minutes wins the silver feather.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Coconut Challenge: </strong>This challenge takes place on a muddy plateau. An enforcer stands on either side of the 400-foot-wide muddy clearing. It begins raining at the outset of this challenge. Each team starts at the same end of the clearing and is given a small coconut marked with the enforcer’s signature. The team that delivers the cleanest coconut to the enforcer on the other side within 1 minute wins a silver feather.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Boulder Challenge: </strong>The enforcer has hidden a silver feather under the rocks and silt of the swiftly flowing river. Also hidden underneath the silt is an iron chain to which the feather is secured with sovereign glue. The other end of the chain is locked around a 500-pound boulder; there is 20 feet of slack between the boulder and the feather. The bridge is 50 feet above the river and the river is 4 feet deep. All competitors must remain in contact with the bridge at all times. The first team to get a hand on the feather wins.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Treasure: </strong>The characters can earn up to 3 silver feathers if they win all three challenges.

Instead, they call upon Syndara’s powers of creation to provide a small army to attack the other teams and either eliminate them completely, or, at the very least, soften them up for the final day of the pre-qualifier. Syndara agrees, using his planar powers to create dozens of construct warriors that resemble the famous terra-cotta statues of Lingshen.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">These replica soldiers bear obvious Taumatan markings, making it easier to dismiss the attack as a strange occurrence tied to Bonmu’s ancient history, though a character who succeeds at a DC 25 Bonmu Lore or DC 40 Perception check can deduce that the Taumatan markings are convincing forgeries.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>First Wave</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The first attack begins shortly after midnight. Several terra-cotta soldiers climb the walls into the temple’s training space (area A10) and then seek out the characters, possibly catching them in their sleep.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creatures:</strong> These terra-cotta soldiers all bear a small fragment of planar power thanks to Syndara’s influence. The statues use this power to pinch the Material Plane around them and teleport across the battlefield with terrifying speed.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>4 Planar Terra-Cotta Soldiers</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Second Wave</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Once the characters destroy the last soldier, they have some time to regain their bearings. The next attack begins 15 minutes after the first ended. If the Old Man statue remains intact at the temple shrine (area <strong>A13</strong>), it registers the second attack and springs to life to aid the characters in defending the temple.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creatures: </strong>A large squadron of terra-cotta soldiers teleports into the training space again, this time with the intent of using their large numbers to overwhelm the characters.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Planar Terra-Cotta Squadron</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Third Wave</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">With the destruction of the terra-cotta squadron, the player characters earn 10 minutes of relative calm before the next attack. If the Old Man statue remains, it begins to chant an Iroran prayer to cast bless on all allied creatures within 10 feet of the statue. This blessing lasts for the duration of the third attack.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creatures: </strong>A quartet of powerful terra-cotta soldiers teleport into the temple courtyard (area A3) and then seek out the characters.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>4 Planar Terra-Cotta Captains</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Forth Wave</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The final wave arrives only 5 minutes after the destruction of the terra-cotta captains. By this point, Irori himself takes notice of the characters’ actions and offers them a blessing to aid them during their defense. Immediately after the end of the third wave, through the Old Man statue, Irori casts a 2-action, 9th-level heal on each character, restoring 9d8+72 Hit Points each. Additionally, if the characters took the time to fully clear the temple or otherwise made a show of piety, Irori also casts a 9th-level heroism spell on the characters, which lasts for the remainder of the attack. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"><strong>Creatures: </strong>What terra-cotta soldiers remain pour into the temple. The captains enter via the courtyard again and the squadron enters via the training space, with both groups looking to pincer the characters in the center of the temple.</span></p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>4 Planar Terra-Cotta Soldiers</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p>","img":"","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wgjTDLixUZ8YXqS9":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"type":"base","scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.hRkhdlbXzuCBr9vf"},"cf":{"id":"temp_sb55ol5wixk"}}}
{"_id":"JzKJaTd3eFQF5sUQ","name":"Wandering Teams","content":"<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\">@Compendium[qwert-fotrp.fotrp-1.w81sKG50X9aHOO1L]{Chapter 2: Survive}</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Thirty-two teams vie for entry into the Ruby Phoenix Tournament proper, and each of these teams roams Bonmu attempting to earn their silver feathers. Use the following teams whenever the player characters actively search for other teams or when you feel like introducing some excitement to the exploration. If the characters purposefully search for a team, they typically find a group of challengers within 4 hexploration actions. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">At your consideration, the player characters might face these teams at a lower or higher level than presented here. You can modify teams’ threat levels by applying the weak or elite creature adjustments (page 6 of the Pathfinder Bestiary) to the team’s fighters. The ultimate decision is up to you, but know that some of the teams will be too difficult for lower-level teams. On the other hand, such a fight can be a perfect way to remind the player characters that they are not unbeatable. Regardless of whether they win or lose, the characters should earn experience for these fights as long as they gave an honest effort for the match. In the case of a loss, award the characters experience for a challenge one threat level lower than the fight’s threat level (low-threat experience for a moderate threat, moderate-threat experience for a severe threat, and so on).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">If these teams don’t fit your needs for an encounter, consider using the Ruby Phoenix Fighting Roster article (page 66) to develop a team concept. From there, you can use the base combatant statistics (page 22) to fill your team with different opponents. </p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Lightning Callers</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creatures: </strong>The Lightning Callers are a pair of expert archers from Osirion. <strong>Morginnar </strong>and <strong>Rameis </strong>do their best to keep away from opponents in combat. If there is higher ground for them to use, they quickly make their way toward that location first. Otherwise, they attempt to pin their opponents before moving away. Both Morginnar and Rameis fight until reduced to 25 Hit Points, at which point they surrender.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Morginna and </strong><strong>Rameis </strong>(human archery specialists)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Nightmares</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The Nightmares are a trio of horse riders from the Xopatl region of Arcadia. Named after the fiendish horses of death—which they’ve outfitted their mounts to resemble—the Nightmares dress in black robes and wield polearms against their foes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creatures: </strong>Junerio, Rovidar, and Tairino are cousins who grew up together and got by as thieves. They eventually realized they could avoid all the subterfuge and sneaking around by instead simply terrifying their victims into submission. In combat, the trio encircle one or two opponents at a time, staying mounted and using their halberds to attack from a safe distance. All of the Nightmares fight until knocked out.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Junerio, Rovidar, Tairino </strong>(human agile warriors)</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>3 Specialist War Horses</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Golarion's Finest</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The eight fighters who call themselves Golarion’s Finest met at a previous worldwide tournament many years ago. They all enjoyed their time together so much that they formed their own team. Since then, they’ve entered multiple tournaments, traveling around Golarion in search of their next fight. Their incredible winning record earned them a place among Hao Jin’s chosen pre-qualifiers for the Ruby Phoenix Tournament.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Creatures:</strong> Each of Golarion’s Finest specializes in a specific technique. The Quain fraternal twins Han and Jun have each mastered their punches and kicks respectively. Mingyu was a former teacher from Goka who found an even greater passion in fighting. Krankkiss and Rajna attended a monastery in Vudra where they mastered the flow of ki in their bodies to grant them unusual abilities. Paunnima, a retired wrestling champion from Minkai, took to fighting once again to raise funds for her tea shop. Numoriz was a Razatlani knight, but he retired after the birth of his son; now that his son is an adult, Numoriz has returned to the world of combat but avoided the call to war. Finally, Brartork, an Iobarian body builder, can be credited with the original idea of forming Golarion’s Finest. His gregarious and joyful attitude immediately falls to the wayside in combat, as he takes his grappling and throwing very seriously in order to subdue his opponents. </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">In combat, Golarion’s Finest each try to focus on separate foes, though the large size of the group usually ends with the team breaking into pairs. Han and Jun fight together, attempting to keep a foe pinned down. Krankkiss and Rajna use their unique abilities to take the defensive. Mingyu and Paunnima use their quick attacks to pummel multiple foes at once. Finally, Brartork and Numoriz cover any leftover opponents. Each member surrenders if reduced to fewer than 50 Hit Points. If five or more members are incapacitated, the entire team surrenders.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> The eight members of Golarion’s Finest are represented by the following single stat block, for convenience. Each fighter has their own special ability.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>Golarion's Finest </strong>(8 human ki adepts)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Under the Pale Sun</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">This group of four fighters hails from the Kelesh satrapy of Zelshabbar in Casmaron. They refuse to give their names, and they are sore losers. If the player characters win a match against Under the Pale Sun, the fighters immediately challenge the characters to a rematch at a different fighting site.</p>\n<ul style=\"font-size:1.25em\">\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>2 Under the Pale Sun Dervishes</strong> (human weapon masters)</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify\"><strong>2 Under the Pale Sun Archers </strong>(human archery speicalists) </li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> </p>","img":"","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wgjTDLixUZ8YXqS9":3},"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"type":"base","scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"},"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.hRkhdlbXzuCBr9vf"},"cf":{"id":"temp_gbhn0a6fdhk"}}}
