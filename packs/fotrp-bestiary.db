They particularly enjoy conversations with humans and other civilized humanoids, delighting in the naive customs of these diminutive races without showing them haughtiness or scorn. While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage in this sort of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics so they can anticipate future conflicts. Along the way, they create extensive information networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all levels of humanoid society-networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly assist settlements near their lair. Unlike the schemes and manipulations of blue dragons, brass dragons use their informant networks to establish justice and equality.</p>\n<p>These carefree dragons value independence and feel that all creatures deserve to live as they please, provided they don't harm others. They are emotional creatures and tend to have short attention spans, sometimes falling victim to depression in their twilight years. To combat this, some brass dragons keep pets and houseplants that they can care for.</p>\n<p>Though they may seem childlike in their curiosity concerning mortal affairs, a brass dragon's prowess in battle is no laughing matter. A brass dragon whose territory or allies are threatened is a terrifying foe indeed, quick to shed their innocent guise and unleash their terrifying might upon evildoers.</p>\n<p>Most brass dragons live in desert climates, and while they keep their lairs hidden, they often build near humanoid settlements.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other. In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-flung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"darkvision, scent (imprecise) 60 feet, tremorsense (imprecise) 30 feet"},"traits":{"value":["dragon","fire"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","draconic","gnomish","halfling","sylvan"],"selected":[],"custom":"Speak With Animals"},"di":{"value":["fire","paralyzed","sleep"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"ci":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"}},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"schema":{"version":0.725,"lastMigration":null},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":5},"dex":{"mod":2},"con":{"mod":3},"int":{"mod":3},"wis":{"mod":1},"cha":{"mod":2}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":16,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":15,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":14,"saveDetail":""}}},"token":{"disposition":-1,"height":2,"img":"modules/qwert-fotrp/assets/token/young_brass_dragon.Token.webp?1646537053884","name":"Young Brass Dragon","width":2,"displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"chatbubble":""}},"randomImg":false,"tint":null,"x":null,"y":null,"elevation":null},"items":[{"_id":"XsMSamN905Cp8CUb","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.725,"lastMigration":null},"ability":{"value":"cha"},"spelldc":{"value":18,"dc":25,"mod":0},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"prepared":{"value":"prepared","flexible":false},"showUnpreparedSpells":{"value":false},"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"proficiency":{"value":0},"displayLevels":{"0":false,"1":false,"2":false,"3":false},"slots":{"slot0":{"prepared":{"0":{"id":"REqK2rtFPmIC9FrI"},"1":{"id":"tEqqvMNATOfUWKfk"},"2":{"id":"ovHc6iwENKBAL49a"},"3":{"id":"4Odj1bmu0busYGrb"},"4":{"id":"S7dTuJDhb0WUCcNj"}},"value":0,"max":5},"slot1":{"prepared":{"0":{"id":"J1Fz85uUnj8o2KtZ"},"1":{"id":"z6dLDLnyCyHZlQWQ"},"2":{"id":"BH921E2MW1plWuYr"}},"value":0,"max":3},"slot2":{"prepared":{"0":{"id":"8KiQpua6hLk3j6sZ"},"1":{"id":"TgB4csMOOrabsLpD"},"2":{"id":"PQ1pNUszIIgYGKet"}},"value":0,"max":3},"slot3":{"prepared":{"0":{"id":"WEClnGcdWnFv6yiY"},"1":{"id":"FJzkNFmyJQEV4GbF"}},"value":0,"max":2},"slot4":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot5":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot6":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot7":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot8":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot9":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot10":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot11":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0}},"signatureSpells":{"value":[]},"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":3}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Prepared Spells","sort":100000,"type":"spellcastingEntry","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"6evj7LX0P0Xyv3W8","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.725,"lastMigration":null},"ability":{"value":"cha"},"spelldc":{"value":17,"dc":25,"mod":0},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"prepared":{"value":"innate","flexible":false},"showUnpreparedSpells":{"value":true},"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"proficiency":{"value":0},"displayLevels":{},"slots":{"slot0":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot1":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot2":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot3":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot4":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot5":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot6":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot7":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot8":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot9":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot10":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot11":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0}},"signatureSpells":{"value":[]},"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Innate Spells","sort":200000,"type":"spellcastingEntry","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"WEClnGcdWnFv6yiY","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Using the weight of earth, you hamper a target's flight, with effects based on its Fortitude save.

Their articulated joints and sturdy armored bodies require great care and mathematical precision to craft, and regular cleaning and oiling ensure they don't rust over the ages. With proper care, iron golems can remain in good shape for thousands of years, being passed down for generations, as long as they aren't destroyed by meddlesome adventurers. In addition to their incredible strength, iron golems possess a potent toxic breath weapon that is often more than enough to dispatch entire groups of opponents.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure positive energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p>\n<p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question.

Each day when you prepare your spells, you can designate a single item you own as your bonded item. This is typically an item associated with spellcasting, such as a wand, ring, or staff, but you are free to designate a weapon or other item. You gain the Drain Bonded Item free action.</p>\n<h3>@Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.v82XtjAVN4ffgVVR]{Drain Bonded Item} <span class=\"pf2-icon\">F</span></h3>\n<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per day</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You haven't acted yet on your turn</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You expend the power stored in your bonded item. During your turn, you gain the ability to cast one spell you prepared today and already cast, without spending a spell slot. You must still Cast the Spell and meet the spell's other requirements.</p>\n<h2>Arcane School</h2>\n<p>Many arcane spellcasters delve deeply into a single school of magic in an attempt to master its secrets. If you want to be a specialist wizard, choose a school in which to specialize. You gain additional spells and spell slots for spells of your school.</p>\n<p>If you don't choose a school, you're a universalist, a wizard who believes that the path to true knowledge of magic requires a multidisciplinary understanding of all eight schools working together. Though a universalist lacks the focus of a specialist wizard, they have greater fiexibility.</p>\n<p>Arcane schools can be found here (@Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.gCwcys8CnS102tji]{Arcane School: Abjuration}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.SNeVaUBTHwvoO6kr]{Arcane School: Conjuration}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.yobGgrHdgjs5QW5o]{Arcane School: Divination}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ZHwGACWQEy6kTzcP]{Arcane School: Enchantment}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.ibhml5y20g5M3Vgd]{Arcane School: Evocation}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.K6hG7nH8yjmbA0Q9]{Arcane School: Illusion}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.uNM7qZQokRKAEd7k]{Arcane School: Necromancy}, @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.rHxkPijLnQ9O9AGV]{Arcane School: Transmutation} and @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.qczCKdg47eAmCOUD]{Arcane School: Universalist})</p>\n<h2>Arcane Spellcasting</h2>\n<p>Through dedicated study and practice, you can harness arcane power to cast spells. You can cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, you can prepare up to two 1st-level spells and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below), plus one extra cantrip and spell of your chosen school of each level you can cast if you are a specialist wizard. Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots.</p>\n<p>As you increase in level as a wizard, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, shown in Table 3-19: Wizard Spells per Day.</p>\n<p>Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Intelligence, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3><strong>Heightening Spells</strong></h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.</p>\n<h3><strong>Cantrips</strong></h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a wizard. For example, as a 1st-level wizard, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level wizard, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<h3><strong>Spellbook</strong></h3>\n<p>Every arcane spell has a written version, usually recorded in a spellbook. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study to prepare your spells each day. The spellbook contains your choice of 10 arcane cantrips and five 1st-level arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you. It might be a musty, leather-bound tome or an assortment of thin metal disks connected to a brass ring; its name might be esoteric, like <em>The Crimson Libram</em>, or something more academic, like <em>A Field Study in Practical Transmutation</em>.</p>\n<p>Each time you gain a level, you add two arcane spells to your spellbook, of any level for which you have spell slots. You can also use the Arcana skill to add other spells that you find in your adventures.</p>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Your Level</th>\n<th>Cantrips</th>\n<th>1st</th>\n<th>2nd</th>\n<th>3rd</th>\n<th>4th</th>\n<th>5th</th>\n<th>6th</th>\n<th>7th</th>\n<th>8th</th>\n<th>9th</th>\n<th>10th</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"color: white; width: 120px; background-color: #522e2c; text-align: center; height: 25px;\" colspan=\"12\">* The Archwizard's Spellcraft class feature gives you a 10th-level spell slot that works a bit differently from other spell slots.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Arcane Thesis</h2>\n<p>During your studies to become a full-fledged wizard, you produced a thesis of unique magical research on one of a variety of topics. You gain a special benefit depending on the topic of your thesis research. The arcane thesis topics presented in this book are below; your specific thesis probably has a much longer and more technical title like \"On the Methods of Spell Interpolation and the Genesis of a New Understanding of the Building Blocks of Magic.\"</p>\n<p>Arcane thesis can be found here @Compendium[pf2e.classfeatures.M89l9FOnjHe63wD7]{Arcane Thesis}.</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>Wizard Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a wizard class feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Extended practice of the arcane has improved your capabilities. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Magical Fortitude<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Magical power has improved your body's resiliency. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Alertness<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Wizard Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Through a combination of magic and training, you've learned how to wield wizard weapons more effectively. You gain expert proficiency in the club, crossbow, dagger, heavy crossbow, staff, and unarmed attacks.</p>\n<h2>Defensive Robes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>The flow of magic and your training combine to help you avoid attacks. Your proficiency rank in unarmored defense increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal an additional 2 damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You command superlative spellcasting ability. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success at a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Archwizard's Spellcraft<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You command the most potent arcane magic and can cast a spell of truly incredible power. You gain a single 10th-level spell slot and can prepare a spell in that slot using arcane spellcasting. You can't use this spell slot for abilities that let you cast spells without expending spell slots or that give you more spell slots. Unlike with other spell slots, you don't gain more 10th-level spells as you level up, though you can take the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.tP26mgaFPpr6df1i]{Archwizard's Might} feat to gain a second slot.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You are a consummate spellcaster, with a comprehensive understanding of both arcane theory and practical spellcraft.

After leaving the world in ancient times, they returned to a changed land, and they still struggle to reclaim their ancestral homes, most notably from terrible demons that have invaded parts of their lands. To some, the elves are objects of awe—graceful and beautiful, with immense talent and knowledge. Among themselves, however, the elves place far more importance on personal freedom than on living up to these ideals.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Elves combine otherworldly grace, sharp intellect, and mysterious charm in a way that is practically magnetic to members of other ancestries. They are often voraciously intellectual, though their studies delve into a level of detail that most shorter-lived peoples find excessive or inefficient. Valuing kindness and beauty, elves ever strive to improve their manners, appearance, and culture.</p>\n<p>Elves are often rather private people, steeped in the secrets of their groves and kinship groups. They're slow to build friendships outside their kinsfolk, but for a specific reason: they subtly and deeply attune to their environment and their companions. There's a physical element to this attunement, but it isn't only superficial. Elves who spend their lives among shorter‑lived peoples often develop a skewed perception of their own mortality and tend to become morose after watching generation after generation of companions age and die. These elves are called the Forlorn.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who is magical, mystical, and mysterious, you should play an elf.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Carefully curate your relationships with people with shorter lifespans, either keeping a careful emotional distance or resigning yourself to outliving them.</li>\n<li>Adopt specialized or obscure interests simply for the sake of mastering them.</li>\n<li>Have features such as eye color, skin tone, hair, or mannerisms that reflect the environment in which you live.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus on your appearance, either admiring your grace or treating you as if you're physically fragile.</li>\n<li>Assume you practice archery, cast spells, fight demons, and have perfected one or more fine arts.</li>\n<li>Worry that you privately look down on them, or feel like you're condescending and aloof.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>While generally taller than humans, elves possess a fragile grace, accentuated by long features and sharply pointed ears. Their eyes are wide and almond-shaped, featuring large and vibrant-colored pupils that make up the entire visible portion of the eye. These pupils give them an alien look and allow them to see sharply even in very little light.</p>\n<p>Elves gradually adapt to their environment and their companions, and they often take on physical traits reflecting their surroundings. An elf who has dwelled in primeval forests for centuries, for example, might exhibit verdant hair and gnarled fingers, while one who's lived in a desert might have golden pupils and skin. Elven fashion, like the elves themselves, tends to reflect their surroundings. Elves living in the forests and other wilderness locales wear clothing that plays off the terrain and flora of their homes, while those who live in cities tend to wear the latest fashions.</p>\n<p>Elves reach physical adulthood around the age of 20, though they aren't considered to be fully emotionally mature by other elves until closer to the passing of their first century, once they've experienced more, held several occupations, and outlived a generation of shorter-lived people. A typical elf can live to around 600 years old.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Elven culture is deep, rich, and on the decline. Their society peaked millennia ago, long before they fled the world to escape a great calamity. They've since returned, but rebuilding is no easy task. Their inborn patience and intellectual curiosity make elves excellent sages, philosophers, and wizards, and their societies are built upon their inherent sense of wonder and knowledge. Elven architecture displays their deep appreciation of beauty, and elven cities are wondrous works of art.</p>\n<p>Elves hold deeply seated ideals of individualism, allowing each elf to explore multiple occupations before alighting on a particular pursuit or passion that suits her best. Elves bear notorious grudges against rivals, which the elves call ilduliel, but these antagonistic relationships can sometimes blossom into friendships over time.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Elves are often emotional and capricious, yet they hold high ideals close to their hearts. As such, many are chaotic good. They prefer deities who share their love of all things mystic and artistic. Desna and Shelyn are particular favorites, the former for her sense of wonder and the latter for her appreciation of artistry. Calistria is the most notorious of elven deities, as she represents many of the elven ideals taken to the extreme.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Many elves adventure to find beauty and discover new things. Typical backgrounds for an elf include emissary, hunter, noble, scholar, or scout. Elves often become rangers or rogues, taking advantage of their dexterity, or alchemists or wizards, exploring their intellectual curiosity.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>An elf keeps their personal name secret among their family, while giving a nickname when meeting other people. This nickname can change over time, due to events in the elf's life or even on a whim. A single elf might be known by many names by associates of different ages and regions. Elven names consist of multiple syllables and are meant to flow lyrically—at least in the Elven tongue. They so commonly end in '-el' or '-ara' that other cultures sometimes avoid names ending in these syllables to avoid sounding too elven.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Aerel, Amrunelara, Caladrel, Dardlara, Faunra, Heldalel, Jathal, Lanliss, Oparal, Seldlon, Soumral, Talathel, Tessara, Variel, Yalandlara, Zordlon</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"traits":{"value":["elf","humanoid"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"elf","schema":{"version":0.725,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-03-05T16:45:27.262+07:00","version":{"schema":0.72,"foundry":"9.254","system":"3.6.0.10666"}}},"hp":6,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":30,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["dex"]},"1":{"value":["int"]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":["con"]}},"languages":{"value":["common","elven","taldane"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":["celestial","draconic","gnoll","gnomish","goblin","orcish","sylvan"],"custom":""},"items":{},"vision":"lowLightVision"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wgjTDLixUZ8YXqS9":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.PgKmsA2aKdbLU6O0"}}},{"_id":"194m1vbln0aps8bj","name":"Ancient Elf (Witch Dedication)","type":"heritage","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/ancestry/ancient-elf.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>In your long life, you've dabbled in many paths and many styles. typical ancient elf is at least 100 years old, though you might be younger at the GM's discretion.

Their shadowy, incorporeal forms are dotted with burning eyes that reffect their hatred for the living, and shadowy claws are weapon enough to steal the vitality from their enemies. A wraith may be created by foul necromancy, but more often they are the result of a hermitic murderer or mutilator who even in death could not give up their wicked ways. Further complicating the matter is the fact that wraiths multiply by consuming and transforming the living into more of their foul kind-meaning a handful of wraiths left unchecked can easily turn into a horde of darkness.</p>\n<p>Wraiths weigh nothing and are unharmed by most physical attacks. They haunt any place where they can feed on the living, though their vulnerability to sunlight confines them to the shadowy places of the world-places where they can blend in seamlessly with their dark surroundings before silently engulfing their prey.</p>\n<p>Wraiths may form packs with others of their kind in places where death and mayhem are commonplace-countrysides ravaged by war, metropolitan underworlds run by criminal overlords, or sites of fiendish cultic rituals. In these places, the living do well to tread with sunrods and powerful clerics in tow. Ruins, sewers, and abandoned buildings provide sanctuary for wraiths during the day, as the creatures hunt exclusively at night or in dark places. Wraiths are smart enough to take advantage of their incorporeality in combat, so they keep to tortuous caverns or structures with hallways and avoid open areas.</p>\n<p>As they're formed purely of anti-life from the Negative Energy Plane, wraiths pervade that unholy realm. Within nations and civilizations ruled by the undead, wraiths have places of power as assassins and spies. They're among the ruling class in Geb, but have greater numbers in Ustalav, where packs of wraiths roam graveyards and misty trails, consuming the populations of entire villages. In other parts of the world, wraiths tend not to wander and limit their activity to smaller environs, typically just the site of their chosen haunting and its immediate surroundings.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"darkvision, lifesense 60

They're often made to serve as works of art when at rest, so some golem crafters employ master sculptors to ensure the constructs make beautiful statues. Older stone golems might be weathered, with scuffed or cracked surfaces or missing noses and digits, but this weathering is largely cosmetic and doesn't adversely impact the golems' functionality.</p>\n<p>Tales tell of particularly immense stone golems residing in certain ancient ruins. Survivors from time-lost civilizations bent on carrying out orders from long-gone masters, these immense stone golems are much more powerful than most stone golems. They are always level 15 or higher and never smaller than Huge in size-most are Gargantuan. Because their size is so great and the structures they dwell in so dilapidated, the awakening of such a stone golem can cause surrounding structures to collapse, ancient foundations to buckle, and ceilings to come crashing down on foes. In addition to the statistics here, these massive stone golems attack with wide, sweeping strikes capable of knocking down multiple targets at once.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure positive energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures. The process of creating a golem is time-consuming, expensive, and difficult, and only the most talented spellcasters or artisans can even hope to accomplish such an undertaking. While certain magical texts-so-called \"golem manuals\"-are said to aid golems crafters, for the most part the creation of a golem should be something left in the hands of the Game Master.</p>\n<p>Golems have components that can be harvested as trophies or magical components; the value depends on the golem in question.

These lithe and shadowy beings seem to sink and vanish into the gloom. They see in darkness, exercise control over shadows, and have strange occult powers. Some fetchlings develop their powers enough to pass between the Shadow and Material Planes, leaving other ancestries to whisper about figures that emerge from shaded corners and then vanish without a trace. Through magic and other means, they've spread across Golarion and the planes beyond, as adaptable as the humans they once were.</p>\n<p>The first fetchlings were refugees. Ages ago, when Earthfall destroyed ancient Azlant and cast the world into darkness, one small group of Azlanti pleaded for rescue. A mysterious hooded figure known as the Widow answered their call, slicing open a passage into the Shadow Plane. The Azlanti stepped through, trading the darkness of Earthfall for a deep shadow. As they navigated the plane's strange environs and dangerous inhabitants, its nature slowly worked monumental changes on the survivors.</p>\n<p>If you want a character more at home in a mirror world of shadow, infused with umbral gloom, and who embodies the dualities of light and darkness, you should play a fetchling.</p>\n<h2>You Might…</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Live and work in gloomy areas of dim light with plenty of shadows, only providing bright light when expecting visitors.</li>\n<li>Look to people's shadows as a way of identifying them, alongside features like stature or facial structure.</li>\n<li>Maintain composure when faced with strange creatures and circumstances.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably…</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Believe you have shadowy powers, such as the ability to consume light as food, melt into darkness, or travel between planes.</li>\n<li>Expect you to be cautious, reserved, and a loner.</li>\n<li>Express interest in your ancestral physiological connection to the Shadow Plane.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Most of the Shadow Plane appears as an altered version of the Material Plane but leeched of color. These same forces in the Shadow Plane have touched fetchlings, whose skin tones fall on a monochromatic scale from stark white to deep black, and all the shades of gray between. Their bodies are just as diverse in shape and size as humans, though most display a certain fluidity of motion reminiscent of shifting shadows. Fetchlings' reflective, pupilless eyes can pierce darkness. A fetchling's most notable feature is their shadow, which almost never faithfully reflects their body. Instead, fetchling shadows might have incongruous shapes or sizes, while others flicker, move of their own accord, or imitate the shadow of another nearby creature.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Most fetchlings remain close to Golarion on either the Material or Shadow Planes, either forming majority-fetchling communities or forging solitary paths. Both planar groups tend to be insular; many fetchling cultures preserve memories of their early, perilous days confronting the Shadow Plane's hostile or beguiling denizens. Their predilection for forming tight communal bonds and adapting to local customs has spread to become part of broader fetchling culture, reinforced by two major fetchling groups—the Estlaris and Sharedars—who live in the shadow of more powerful entities.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>A culture of survival passed down through generations means many fetchlings prefer to maintain a cautious worldview and adapt to prevailing circumstances. As a result, many trend toward a neutral outlook on life. Some choose to join with local powers for personal or communal advancement, or to tear systems down from the inside. Others attempt to shatter what they see as fetters that bind them and their communities.</p>\n<p>No small number of fetchlings are nonreligious, recognizing all gods' powers but revering none. Faithful fetchlings prefer gods that offer protection and stability, be it the pastoral embrace of Erastil or the binding chains of Zon-Kuthon. Those who travel alone or pass between planes seek the comfort of Alseta, Desna, and Gozreh. Calistria appeals to ambitious fetchlings, while Grandmother Spider and Sivanah help those who wish to move through the world unnoticed or unfettered. Some worship these three as a pantheon called the Laughing Veil; a few even include Norgorber as a fourth member.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Fetchlings adapted to a new world, and their names do the same. These names commonly include phonetic qualities from multiple languages or are simply local cultural names that fetchling families find compelling. Other dominant naming conventions include flowing sounds, harsh or hissing consonants, and surnames that refer to important relatives or community traits.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Amelisce, Ashka, Drosil, Eitsanara, Eomva, Ikyamek, Inva, Jegan, Lirtae, Meotrai, Sorsul, Zokaratz</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Lost Omens: Ancestry Guide"},"traits":{"value":["fetchling","humanoid"],"rarity":"uncommon","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"fetchling","schema":{"version":0.725,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-03-05T16:45:22.718+07:00","version":{"schema":0.72,"foundry":"9.254","system":"3.6.0.10666"}}},"hp":8,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["dex"]},"1":{"value":[]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":[]}},"languages":{"value":["shadowtongue","tien"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":["aklo","dziriak","draconic","necril","undercommon"],"custom":""},"items":{},"vision":"darkvision"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"bHYY1G6wdeVgG3xj":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.ancestries.hIA3qiUsxvLZXrFP"}}},{"_id":"dtyknq6u87wn5l4c","name":"Wisp Fetchling","type":"heritage","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/heritage.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Your ancestors' exposure to the Shadow Plane wrought great physical changes.

You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.QDW9H8XLIjuW2fE4]{Spellstrike} activity.</p>\n<h3>Spellstrike Specifics</h3>\n<p>Though the base Spellstrike rules cover most spells, various modifications apply to more complicated spells when loaded into your fist, blade, or other attack.</p>\n<p><strong>One Target</strong> The spell targets only the target of your Strike, even if it normally allows more targets. Some feats let you affect more creatures.</p>\n<p>Reach: The coupled spell affects the target using the reach of the weapon or unarmed attack you make your Spellstrike with. For instance, shocking grasp would affect a creature beyond the reach of your hand if you used a weapon with reach, and ray of frost would affect only a creature in your weapon's reach, even though the spell's range is longer.</p>\n<p><strong>Ancillary Effects</strong> Your spell still has any non-targeted effects that might affect creatures other than the target, as well as any ongoing effects starting from the moment you hit with the Strike. For example, acid splash would still deal its splash damage to creatures other than the target and tanglefoot's circumstance penalty would last for its normal duration. The spell takes effect after the Strike deals damage; if the Strike has other special effects, the GM determines whether they happen before or after the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple Defenses</strong> Any additional rolls after the initial spell attack still happen normally, such as the Fortitude save attempted by the target of a disintegrate spell. Similarly, a spell that allows you to attack with it again on subsequent rounds would only combine a Strike with its initial attack roll, not with any later ones. Invalid or Immune Target: If the target you hit wouldn't be a valid target for the spell, the spell is still expended but doesn't affect the target. If the target is immune to your attack but not the spell, it can still be affected by the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Variable Actions</strong> Some spells have different effects based on the number of actions you spend to cast them. You choose whether to use the effects of the 1- or 2-action version of the spell when you use Spellstrike. A spell has to take exactly 1 or 2 actions; you can't use Spellstrike with a spell that takes a free action, reaction, or 3 or more actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Metamagic</strong> You typically can't use metamagic with Spellstrike because metamagic requires the next action you take to be Cast a Spell, and Spellstrike is a combined activity that doesn't qualify.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["magus"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[{"key":"GrantItem","uuid":"Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.QDW9H8XLIjuW2fE4"}],"slug":"spellstrike","schema":{"version":0.725,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-03-05T16:45:22.718+07:00","version":{"schema":0.72,"foundry":"9.254","system":"3.6.0.10666"}}},"level":{"value":1},"featType":{"value":"classfeature"},"onlyLevel1":false,"maxTakable":1,"actionType":{"value":"passive"},"actionCategory":{"value":""},"actions":{"value":null},"prerequisites":{"value":[]},"location":"wji1x4kbuopihj8s"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"bHYY1G6wdeVgG3xj":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.KVj5ofUwu3VJSrVw"},"pf2e":{"itemGrants":["heudycygjx5gtlj7"]}}},{"_id":"n0fx8fyyiw0cmwee","name":"Lightning Reflexes","type":"feat","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/lightning-reflexes.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast.

You can cast arcane spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because you're a magus, you can draw replacement sigils with the tip of your weapon or your free hand for spells requiring material components, replacing them with somatic components instead of needing a material component pouch. At 1st level, you can prepare one 1st-level spell and five cantrips each morning from the spells in your spellbook (see below). Prepared spells remain available to you until you cast them or until you prepare your spells again. The number of spells you can prepare is called your spell slots. As you increase in level as a magus, your number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast from spell slots increase, shown in Table 2-2: Magus Spells per Day. Because you split your focus between physical training and magical scholarship, you have no more than two spell slots of your highest level and, if you can cast 2nd-level spells or higher, two spell slots of 1 level lower than your highest spell level. Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n<h3>Heightening Spells</h3>\n<p>When you get spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell's level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they're heightened to certain levels.</p>\n<h3>Cantrips</h3>\n<p>A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn't use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up-this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a magus. For example, as a 1st-level magus, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level magus, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.</p>\n<h3>Spellbook</h3>\n<p>Every arcane spell has a written version, usually recorded in a spellbook. You start with a spellbook worth 10 sp or less, which you receive for free and must study to prepare your spells each day. The spellbook contains your choice of eight arcane cantrips and four 1st-level arcane spells. You choose these from the common spells on the arcane spell list or from other arcane spells you gain access to. Your spellbook's form and name are up to you.

You gain the Spellstrike activity.</p>\n<h3>Spellstrike Specifics</h3>\n<p>Though the base Spellstrike rules cover most spells, various modifications apply to more complicated spells when loaded into your fist, blade, or other attack.</p>\n<p><strong>One Target</strong> The spell targets only the target of your Strike, even if it normally allows more targets. Some feats let you affect more creatures.</p>\n<p><strong>Reach</strong> The coupled spell affects the target using the reach of the weapon or unarmed attack you make your Spellstrike with. For instance, shocking grasp would affect a creature beyond the reach of your hand if you used a weapon with reach, and ray of frost would affect only a creature in your weapon's reach, even though the spell's range is longer.</p>\n<p><strong>Ancillary Effects</strong> Your spell still has any non-targeted effects that might affect creatures other than the target, as well as any ongoing effects starting from the moment you hit with the Strike. For example, acid splash would still deal its splash damage to creatures other than the target and tanglefoot's circumstance penalty would last for its normal duration. The spell takes effect after the Strike deals damage; if the Strike has other special effects, the GM determines whether they happen before or after the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiple Defenses</strong> Any additional rolls after the initial spell attack still happen normally, such as the Fortitude save attempted by the target of a disintegrate spell. Similarly, a spell that allows you to attack with it again on subsequent rounds would only combine a Strike with its initial attack roll, not with any later ones.</p>\n<p><strong>Invalid or Immune Target</strong> If the target you hit wouldn't be a valid target for the spell, the spell is still expended but doesn't affect the target. If the target is immune to your attack but not the spell, it can still be affected by the spell.</p>\n<p><strong>Variable Actions</strong> Some spells have different effects based on the number of actions you spend to cast them. You choose whether to use the effects of the 1- or 2-action version of the spell when you use Spellstrike. A spell has to take exactly 1 or 2 actions; you can't use Spellstrike with a spell that takes a free action, reaction, or 3 or more actions.</p>\n<p><strong>Metamagic</strong> You typically can't use metamagic with Spellstrike because metamagic requires the next action you take to be Cast a Spell, and Spellstrike is a combined activity that doesn't qualify.</p>\n<h2>Arcane Cascade</h2>\n<p>After you wield magic, you can enter a special stance to make your attacks more effective.</p>\n<h2>Hybrid Study</h2>\n<p>Your extensive physical training and carefully chosen magic combine to form a unique and dangerous fighting style that's more than the sum of its parts. You choose one field of hybrid study to represent your particular combination of skills. Your hybrid study gives you a special ability, usually tied to Spellstrike or Arcane Cascade, and it determines your initial conflux spell. The hybrid studies presented in this book are as follows.</p>\n<h3>Inexorable Iron</h3>\n<p>Once you begin along a path, nothing can stop you from reaching its end. You transform the mass of a greataxe, greatsword, or polearm into an unstoppable force to augment your own striking power or keep you standing on the battlefield. When you enter Arcane Cascade stance and at the start of each of your turns while you're in that stance, if you're wielding a melee weapon in two hands, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to half your level (minimum 1 temporary HP).</p>\n<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> thunderous strike</p>\n<h3>Laughing Shadow</h3>\n<p>Magic is freeing, a means to your ends, and you can use it to go where you want, do as you please, and avoid the consequences. You are a laughing shadow of spell and blade, always one step ahead of your foes, always with a trick up your sleeve.</p>\n<p>While in Arcane Cascade stance, you gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speeds, or a +10-foot bonus if you're unarmored. If you have a free hand while in the stance and are attacking a @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} creature, you increase the extra damage to 3, to 5 if you have weapon specialization, or to 7 if you have greater weapon specialization. You must have your other hand completely free; the extra damage doesn't apply if you have a free-hand weapon or other item in that hand, even if you would normally be able to use the hand for other things.</p>\n<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> dimensional assault</p>\n<h3>Sparkling Targe</h3>\n<p>You've studied the applications of magic, training yourself to perform not just offensive maneuvers but defensive tactics as well. When magic flows through you, your shield can block impossible things, even a dragon's breath or a magic missile.</p>\n<p>You gain the Shield Block general feat.</p>\n<p>When you're in Arcane Cascade stance with your shield raised, your circumstance bonus to AC from your shield also applies to your saves against spells and other magical effects. In addition, damage you take as a result of a spell or magical effect while you're in Arcane Cascade can trigger your Shield Block reaction, even if the damage isn't physical. When blocking damage in this way, increase your shield's Hardness by an amount equal to the extra damage from Arcane Cascade (typically 1, but 2 if you have weapon specialization, or 3 if you have greater weapon specialization). These benefits apply whether you're using an actual shield, the shield spell, or something else that works like a shield (such as a raised tome if you have the Raise a Tome feat).</p>\n<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> shielding strike</p>\n<h3>Starlit Span</h3>\n<p>With magic, the sky's the limit, and you can't be bound by the confines of physical proximity. Your power reaches as far as your senses can perceive, transcending the space between you and your target even with spells that normally require direct physical contact.</p>\n<p>When you use Spellstrike, you can make a ranged weapon or ranged unarmed Strike, as long as the target is within the first range increment of your ranged weapon or ranged unarmed attack. You can deliver the spell even if its range is shorter than the range increment of your ranged attack.</p>\n<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> shooting star</p>\n<h3>Twisting Tree</h3>\n<p>The staff is perhaps one of the simplest of weapons, but this simplicity belies its elegance and versatility. To you, a staff is casting implement and martial weapon alike-the foundation of a fighting style.</p>\n<p>While you wield a staff in one hand, the staff adjusts in shape and weight, gaining the agile trait and increasing its damage die size to 1d6. While you wield a staff in both hands, it lengthens, twists, and reshapes, gaining the parry, reach, and trip traits. While you're in Arcane Cascade stance, you can Interact or Release to change your grip on the weapon as a free action when you Strike with your staff, including Strikes made in a Spellstrike. This happens before you roll your attack roll. You can also Interact to change your grip on the staff as a free action triggered at the end of your turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Conflux Spell</strong> spinning staff</p>\n<h2>Conflux Spells</h2>\n<p>You learn a conflux spell from your hybrid study, and you can cast additional conflux spells by selecting certain feats. Conflux spells are magus-specific spells created for combat and are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to both study your spellbook and perform a physical regimen.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don't require spell slots, nor can you cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 points.</p>\n<h2>Magus Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a magus class feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, boost four different ability scores. You can use these boosts to increase ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You've dedicated yourself to learning the intricacies of your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Studious Spells<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your hybrid study grants you additional spells that can enhance your power in combat. You gain two special 2nd-level studious spell slots, which can be used to prepare spider climb, true strike, water breathing, and an additional spell depending on your hybrid study. You add any spells from this class feature to your spellbook. At 11th level, the extra slots increase to 3rd level and you add haste and an additional spell depending on your hybrid study. At 13th level, the extra slots increase to 4th level and you add fly and an additional spell depending on your hybrid study.</p>\n<p><strong>Laughing Shadow</strong> 7th: mirror image; 11th: shift blame; 13th: dimension door</p>\n<p><strong>Sparkling Targe</strong> 7th: resist energy; 11th: warding aggression; 13th: stoneskin</p>\n<p><strong>Starlit Span</strong> 7th: darkvision; 11th: wall of wind; 13th: freedom of movement</p>\n<p><strong>Inexorable Iron</strong> 7th: enlarge; 11th: earthbind; 13th: dimensional anchor</p>\n<p><strong>Twisting Tree</strong> 7th: magic mouth; 11th: slow; 13th: blink</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You can inflict greater injuries with your favored weapons. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Alertness<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Expert Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your fundamental understanding of magic improves, making your spells harder to resist. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to defend yourself better against incoming attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to a wide range of ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Master Spellcaster<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You fortify your spells with masterful prowess. Your proficiency ranks for arcane spell attack rolls and spell DCs increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Medium Armor Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with light and medium armor improves, increasing your ability to avoid blows. Your proficiency ranks for light and medium armor, as well as for unarmed defense, increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Double Spellstrike<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You can extend the magic of spells you store with Spellstrike. After you make a Spellstrike with a spell cast from a spell slot, you retain an echo of the spell, stored in your body. The next time you Spellstrike, you can cast the same spell again without expending a spell slot.</p>\n<p>If you choose to cast a different spell with Spellstrike, or you go 1 minute without using the stored spell, the stored spell dissipates harmlessly.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Secrets of Magic"},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[{"key":"ActiveEffectLike","mode":"upgrade","path":"data.proficiencies.traditions.arcane.rank","value":{"brackets":[{"end":8,"start":1,"value":1},{"end":16,"start":9,"value":2},{"start":17,"value":3}],"field":"actor|data.details.level.value"}}],"slug":"magus","schema":{"version":0.725,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-03-05T16:45:22.718+07:00","version":{"schema":0.72,"foundry":"9.254","system":"3.6.0.10666"}}},"keyAbility":{"value":["dex","str"]},"items":{"31b86":{"id":"9XLUh9iMepZesdmc","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-expertise.webp","level":5,"name":"Weapon Expertise","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"5q48r":{"id":"wXaz41gwqNtTn6tf","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/archwizards-spellcraft.webp","level":1,"name":"Arcane Spellcasting (Magus)","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"8jtpc":{"id":"TUOeATt52P43r5W0","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/lightning-reflexes.webp","level":5,"name":"Lightning Reflexes","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"bq0rq":{"id":"FkbFgmoVz5lHhSMo","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","level":1,"name":"Conflux Spells","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"e0xpi":{"id":"cD3nSupdCvONuHiE","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/expert-spellcaster.webp","level":9,"name":"Expert Spellcaster","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"enge3":{"id":"l1InYvhnQSz6Ucxc","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/master-spellcaster.webp","level":17,"name":"Master Spellcaster","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"jbg78":{"id":"FTeIs1Z1Qeli4BIF","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/choice-feature.webp","level":1,"name":"Hybrid Study","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"jg9zn":{"id":"FCEp9jjxxgRJDJV3","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/medium-armor-expertise.webp","level":11,"name":"Medium Armor Expertise","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"k9o6o":{"id":"9EqIasqfI8YIM3Pt","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-specialization.webp","level":7,"name":"Weapon Specialization","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"lsnm7":{"id":"09iL38CZZEa0q0Mt","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","level":1,"name":"Arcane Cascade","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"nkff5":{"id":"Z7HX6TeFsaup7Dx9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/greater-weapon-specialization.webp","level":15,"name":"Greater Weapon Specialization (Level 15)","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"p6ina":{"id":"cGMSYAErbUG5E8X2","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","level":17,"name":"Medium Armor Mastery","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"se5i8":{"id":"i6563IU7x4L9oRgC","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-mastery.webp","level":13,"name":"Weapon Mastery","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"tgkm3":{"id":"VmPIJomEdmgGrCMS","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","level":19,"name":"Double Spellstrike","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"tkzi2":{"id":"D8CSi8c9XiRpVc5M","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/alertness.webp","level":9,"name":"Alertness","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"uoxoe":{"id":"JQAujUXjczVnYDEI","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/resolve.webp","level":9,"name":"Resolve","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"vcf45":{"id":"KVj5ofUwu3VJSrVw","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","level":1,"name":"Spellstrike","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"x3em9":{"id":"OMZs5y16jZRW9KQK","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/juggerenaut.webp","level":15,"name":"Juggernaut","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"zn731":{"id":"6HCI2iHyBZAr7a4P","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","level":7,"name":"Studious Spells","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"}},"hp":10,"trainedSkills":{"value":["arc"],"additional":2,"custom":""},"perception":1,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":2,"reflex":1,"will":2},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":1,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":1,"medium":1,"heavy":0},"classDC":0,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]},"abilityBoostLevels":{"value":[5,10,15,20]}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"bHYY1G6wdeVgG3xj":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classes.HQBA9Yx2s8ycvz3C"},"pf2e":{"insertedClassFeaturesLevel":11}}},{"_id":"vkw941alcozzf6e9","name":"Starlit Span","type":"feat","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/starlit-span.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>With magic, the sky's the limit, and you can't be bound by the confines of physical proximity.

It even has a form of rudimentary sentience, allowing it to not only discern differences in prey and make limited tactical decisions, but also to avoid creatures that are particularly large or dangerous-looking.</p>\n<p>The area around viper vine hunting grounds is often strewn with the partially devoured remains of victims. It's not unusual to find the rotting corpses of wild animals, ill-fated adventurers, and even giants in the plant's immediate vicinity, along with a scattering of incidental treasure left behind on the corpses.

For example, a property that must be applied to a slashing weapon wouldn't function when you attacked with a fist, but you would gain its benefits if you attacked with a claw or some other slashing unarmed attack.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["agile","finesse","invested","magical","nonlethal","transmutation","unarmed"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[{"key":"Striking","predicate":{"all":["unarmed"]},"selector":"strike-damage"},{"key":"WeaponPotency","predicate":{"all":["unarmed"]},"selector":"attack"}],"slug":"handwraps-of-mighty-blows","schema":{"version":0.725,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-03-05T16:45:22.702+07:00","version":{"schema":0.72,"foundry":"9.254","system":"3.6.0.10666"}}},"quantity":{"value":1},"baseItem":null,"hp":{"value":0},"maxHp":{"value":0},"hardness":{"value":0},"brokenThreshold":{"value":0},"weight":{"value":"-"},"equippedBulk":{"value":""},"price":{"value":"35 gp"},"equipped":{"carryType":"worn","handsHeld":0,"value":false,"inSlot":false},"stackGroup":{"value":""},"bulkCapacity":{"value":""},"negateBulk":{"value":"0"},"containerId":{"value":""},"preciousMaterial":{"value":null},"preciousMaterialGrade":{"value":null},"collapsed":{"value":false},"size":{"value":"med"},"identification":{"status":"identified","unidentified":{"name":"","img":"","data":{"description":{"value":""}}},"misidentified":{}},"usage":{"value":"worngloves"},"level":{"value":4},"invested":{"value":false},"category":"unarmed","group":"brawling","hands":{"value":""},"bonus":{"value":1},"damage":{"value":"","dice":1,"die":"d4","damageType":"bludgeoning"},"bonusDamage":{"value":0},"splashDamage":{"value":null},"range":null,"reload":{"value":""},"MAP":{"value":""},"potencyRune":{"value":1},"strikingRune":{"value":"striking"},"specific":{"value":false},"propertyRune1":{"value":null},"propertyRune2":{"value":null},"propertyRune3":{"value":null},"propertyRune4":{"value":null},"property1":{"value":"","dice":null,"die":"","damageType":"","critDice":null,"critDie":"","critDamage":"","critDamageType":"","criticalConditionType":"","criticalConditionValue":null,"strikeConditionType":"","strikeConditionValue":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.FNDq4NFSN0g2HKWO"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/equipment/worn-items/other-worn-items/handwraps-of-mighty-blows.webp","name":"+1 Striking Handwraps of Mighty Blows","sort":1000000,"type":"weapon","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"SDc0i4HEPHX9vIGF","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>These stiff leather armguards grant you a +1 item bonus to AC and saving throws, and a maximum Dexterity modifier of +5.

Countless stories describe anugobus sneaking around Minatan cities to tinker with and improve upon other humanoids' structures and architecture. Owing to their slight stature and relatively frail bodies, anugobus are said to be particularly shy of larger peoples and creatures. Whether under cover of darkness, during a festival that draws people away from their domiciles, or simply whenever they think they're unseen, anugobus in folklore perform their wondrous restorations and crafting projects in secret nearly without exception. Many popular Tengah stories feature homes ruined by a natural disaster that are then magically restored the next morning or unfinished projects like half-built bridges that are mysteriously completed while its workers wonder at how this was accomplished.</p>\n<p>According to most legends, anugobus are unparalleled masters of architecture and engineering and use this expertise to erect complex structures or greatly improve upon already-existing buildings. Some have questioned these extraordinary stories, but anyone who witnesses an anugobu walk on the walls and ceilings of buildings while improving them knows that such tales aren't that far-fetched. In reality, anugobus are as diverse as any species of humanoid, though they all possess innate gifts for mending and construction, and they can walk on walls and ceilings. Anugobus resemble exceptionally small humans with superficial similarities to Tian-Sings. Most anugobus stand no more than 2 feet tall and weigh about 30 pounds-a diminutive stature that allows them to move in and out of crevices and remain unnoticed by taller folks. Nearly all verifiable anugobu encounters have taken place on the isles of Minata.</p>\n<p>In many anugobu cultures, each anugobu seeks an ultimate life goal, which they call their wonder. A wonder is any particular project that enraptures an anugobu in a way no other will. Any project can be an anugobu's wonder, from repairing a majestic cathedral to hunting a particularly dangerous animal to exploring a mysterious cave. When an anugobu discovers their wonder, it's not uncommon for them to fall into an awestruck trance and commit themselves fully to completing the work, sometimes binging on the project for days or weeks at a time. When an anugobu finishes the last minute details on their wonder, their life's work is considered complete, and they spend the rest of their days aiding other anugobus with their own journeys or taking on apprentices to pass on their skills.</p>\n<p>Once an anugobu apprentice sets out on their own, they travel the world working on small projects here and there to maintain their skills. But an anugobu does not earn the honorable title of wondercrafter until they find their own wonder. Once they discover and finish such a wonder, the anugobu is considered fully mature. As a result of their station and experience, such anugobus possess skills and magic that far surpass most of their kind.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"low-light vision"},"traits":{"value":["anugobu","humanoid"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["anugobu","common","sylvan","terran"],"selected":[],"custom":""},"di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"ci":[],"rarity":"uncommon","size":{"value":"tiny"},"attitude":{"value":"hostile"}},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"schema":{"version":0.725,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-03-05T16:45:22.668+07:00","version":{"schema":0.72,"foundry":"9.254","system":"3.6.0.10666"}}},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":-1},"dex":{"mod":4},"con":{"mod":2},"int":{"mod":6},"wis":{"mod":1},"cha":{"mod":4}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":13,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":19,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":14,"saveDetail":""}}},"token":{"disposition":-1,"height":0.5,"img":"modules/qwert-fotrp/assets/token/ahmitar_anugobu_wondercrafter_.Token.webp?1646528282464","name":"Ahmitar (Anugobu Wondercrafter)","width":0.5,"displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null},"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"flags":{"perfect-vision":{"visionRules":"default","monoVisionColor":"","sightLimit":null,"light":{}},"core":{},"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true},"barbrawl":{"resourceBars":{"bar1":{"order":0,"id":"bar1","attribute":"attributes.hp","max":null,"mincolor":"#FF0000","maxcolor":"#80FF00","ownerVisibility":50,"otherVisibility":0,"position":"bottom-inner"}}},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"chatbubble":""},"monks-little-details":{"token-highlight":""}},"randomImg":false,"tint":null,"x":null,"y":null,"elevation":null},"items":[{"_id":"p2Zc3ftvbeeGJ4aA","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.725,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-03-05T16:45:22.668+07:00","version":{"schema":0.72,"foundry":"9.254","system":"3.6.0.10666"}}},"ability":{"value":"cha"},"spelldc":{"value":17,"dc":25,"mod":0},"tradition":{"value":"occult"},"prepared":{"value":"innate"},"showUnpreparedSpells":{"value":true},"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":true},"proficiency":{"value":0},"displayLevels":{},"slots":{"slot0":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot1":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot2":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot3":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot4":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot5":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot6":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot7":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot8":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot9":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot10":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot11":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0}},"signatureSpells":{"value":[]},"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Innate Occult Spells","sort":100000,"type":"spellcastingEntry","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"ecBm7k5M75PpelxX","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>You blink quickly between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane.

To hide their depravities, these beings disguise themselves as everyday people-typically recluses or eccentrics- and use their proximity to a community to pick out their next targets before striking under cover of night. Manananggals use their long, hollow tongues to drain victims' blood from vital organs such as the liver, and the resulting odd drainage marks make it difficult to determine the exact nature of a victim's death.

For example, a property that must be applied to a slashing weapon wouldn't function when you attacked with a fist, but you would gain its benefits if you attacked with a claw or some other slashing unarmed attack.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["agile","finesse","invested","magical","nonlethal","transmutation","unarmed"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[{"key":"Striking","predicate":{"all":["unarmed"]},"selector":"strike-damage"},{"key":"WeaponPotency","predicate":{"all":["unarmed"]},"selector":"attack"}],"slug":"handwraps-of-mighty-blows","schema":{"version":0.725,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-03-05T16:45:22.659+07:00","version":{"schema":0.72,"foundry":"9.254","system":"3.6.0.10666"}}},"quantity":{"value":1},"baseItem":null,"hp":{"value":0},"maxHp":{"value":0},"hardness":{"value":0},"brokenThreshold":{"value":0},"weight":{"value":"-"},"equippedBulk":{"value":""},"price":{"value":"100 gp"},"equipped":{"carryType":"worn","handsHeld":0,"inSlot":false},"stackGroup":{"value":""},"bulkCapacity":{"value":""},"negateBulk":{"value":"0"},"containerId":{"value":""},"preciousMaterial":{"value":null},"preciousMaterialGrade":{"value":null},"collapsed":{"value":false},"size":{"value":"med"},"identification":{"status":"identified","unidentified":{"name":"","img":"","data":{"description":{"value":""}}},"misidentified":{}},"usage":{"value":"worngloves"},"level":{"value":4},"invested":{"value":false},"category":"unarmed","group":"brawling","hands":{"value":""},"bonus":{"value":1},"damage":{"value":"","dice":1,"die":"d4","damageType":"bludgeoning"},"bonusDamage":{"value":0},"splashDamage":{"value":null},"range":null,"reload":{"value":""},"MAP":{"value":""},"potencyRune":{"value":1},"strikingRune":{"value":"striking"},"specific":{"value":false},"propertyRune1":{"value":null},"propertyRune2":{"value":null},"propertyRune3":{"value":null},"propertyRune4":{"value":null},"property1":{"value":"","dice":null,"die":"","damageType":"","critDice":null,"critDie":"","critDamage":"","critDamageType":"","criticalConditionType":"","criticalConditionValue":null,"strikeConditionType":"","strikeConditionValue":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.FNDq4NFSN0g2HKWO"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/equipment/worn-items/other-worn-items/handwraps-of-mighty-blows.webp","name":"+1 Striking Handwraps of Mighty Blows","sort":100000,"type":"weapon","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"nyeHblOcas1HUolh","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>These stiff leather armguards grant you a +1 item bonus to AC and saving throws, and a maximum Dexterity modifier of +5.

When it's necessary, you can throw them into overdrive to assist you in combat.</p>\n<h2>Innovation</h2>\n<p>While you're always creating inventions, there's one that represents your preeminent work, the one that you hope- with refinement-might change the world. Choose one of the below innovations. Your innovation's level is equal to your level. If your innovation is destroyed, you can spend 1 day of downtime and attempt a Crafting check with a high DC for your level; on a success, you rebuild it. An innovation only works due to your constant maintenance and tinkering, and therefore has no market Price.</p>\n<p>The innovations you can choose from in this book are as follows.</p>\n<h3>Armor</h3>\n<p>Your innovation is a cutting-edge suit of medium armor with a variety of attached gizmos and devices. Choose one of the sets of statistics on Table 2-2: Innovation Armor Statistics for your innovation armor (or choose another set of innovation armor statistics to which you have access).</p>\n<p>Your innovation armor can have fundamental and property runes added to it in the same way as ordinary armor. Because of the unique features of your innovation, everyone except you is untrained in it, even if they would normally be trained (or better) in medium armor. Choose one initial armor modification to apply to your innovation, either from the following or from other initial armor modifications to which you have access.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Harmonic Oscillator</strong> You designed your armor to inaudibly thrum at just the right frequency to create interference against force and sound waves. You gain resistance equal to 3 + half your level to force and sonic damage. When under the effects of Overdrive, the resistance increases by 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Metallic Reactance</strong> The metals in your armor are carefully alloyed to ground electricity and protect from acidic chemical reactions. You gain resistance equal to 3 + half your level to acid and electricity damage. When under the effects of Overdrive, the resistance increases by 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Muscular Exoskeleton (Power Suit Only)</strong> Your armor supports your muscles with a carefully crafted exoskeleton. When you send your armor into overdrive, the exoskeleton supplements your feats of athletics as well. When under the effects of Overdrive, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks; if you're a master in Crafting, this increases to a +2 circumstance bonus.</li>\n<li><strong>Otherworldly Protection</strong> Just because you use science doesn't mean you can't build your armor with carefully chosen materials and gizmos designed to protect against otherworldly attacks. You gain resistance equal to 3 + half your level to negative damage, or to positive damage if you have negative healing (such as if you're a dhampir). You gain the same amount of resistance to any types of alignment damage-good, evil, chaotic, lawful-that can damage you (note that creatures don't take a given type of alignment damage unless they are of the opposing alignment; for instance, you can take evil damage only if you are good in alignment).</li>\n<li><strong>Phlogistonic Regulator</strong> A layer of insulation within your armor protects you from rapid temperature fluctuations. You gain resistance equal to half your level to cold and fire damage. When under the effects of Overdrive, the resistance increases by 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Speed Boosters</strong> You have boosters in your armor that increase your Speed. You gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed, which increases to a +10-foot status bonus when under the effects of Overdrive.</li>\n<li><strong>Subtle Dampeners (Subterfuge Suit Only)</strong> You've designed your armor to help you blend in and dampen noise slightly. When you send your armor into overdrive, the dampeners increase their effect, improving your Stealth. When under the effects of Overdrive, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks. If you're a master in Crafting, this increases to a +2 circumstance bonus.</li>\n</ul>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Medium Armor</th>\n<th>AC Bonus</th>\n<th>Dex Cap</th>\n<th>Check Penalty</th>\n<th>Speed Penalty</th>\n<th>Strength</th>\n<th>Bulk</th>\n<th>Group</th>\n<th>Armor Traits</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Power Suit</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>-2</td>\n<td>-5 feet</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>composite</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Subterfuge Suit</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>-1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>composite</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Construct</h3>\n<p>Your innovation is a mechanical creature, such as a clockwork construct made of cogs and gears. It's a prototype construct companion, and you can adjust most of its base statistics by taking feats at higher levels, such as Advanced Companion. If you use the Overdrive action, your construct gains the same Overdrive benefits you do, and it also takes the same amount of fire damage on a critical failure.</p>\n<p>You know how to spend additional time directing, controlling, or programming your construct innovation for a more complex plan of action. You can spend 2 actions to Command instead of 1 when commanding your construct companion; your construct companion can then use an additional action (normally 3 actions, rather than 2).</p>\n<p>Choose one initial construct modification to apply to your innovation, either from the following or from other initial construct modifications to which you have access. These modifications alter the construct's abilities or form.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Accelerated Mobility</strong> Actuated legs, efficient gears in the wheels or treads, or add-on boosters make your construct faster. Your innovation's Speed increases to 40 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Amphibious Construction</strong> Increased buoyancy, rudders, and a means of propulsion like a fluked tail or powerful propeller make your construct able to travel in water. Your innovation gains a swim Speed of 25 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased Size</strong> You built your construct innovation bigger than most. Your construct is Large. If you have this modification and your construct innovation becomes an advanced construct companion or otherwise gains the ability to become Large, you can immediately change increased size to a different initial construct modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Manual Dexterity</strong> Your construct innovation has articulated hands or similar appendages with significant manual dexterity. It can perform manipulate actions with up to two of its limbs. As normal for a companion, it still can't wield weapons or held items that don't have the companion trait, and it can't activate items.</li>\n<li><strong>Projectile Launcher</strong> Your construct has a mounted dart launcher, embedded cannon, or similar armament. Your innovation gains a ranged unarmed attack that deals 1d4 bludgeoning or piercing damage (you choose when you pick this modification). The attack has the propulsive trait and a range increment of 30 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Sensory Array</strong> Additional sensory devices give your innovation low-light vision and darkvision, as well as imprecise tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Wonder Gears</strong> You map specialized skills into your construct's crude intelligence. Your innovation becomes trained in Intimidation, Stealth, and Survival.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Weapon</h3>\n<p>Your innovation is an impossible-looking weapon augmented by numerous unusual mechanisms. It begins with the same statistics as a level 0 common simple or martial weapon of your choice, or another level 0 simple or martial weapon to which you have access. You can instead use the statistics of a 1st-level common simple or martial weapon of your choice, or another 1st-level simple or martial weapon to which you have access, but you must pay the monetary Price for the weapon. An innovation weapon can have fundamental and property runes added to it in the same way as an ordinary weapon. Because of the unique features of your innovation, everyone except you is untrained in it, even if they would normally be trained (or better) in simple or martial weapons. If you use the Overdrive action, you can choose to change the additional damage from Overdrive to fire damage. Choose one initial weapon modification to apply to your innovation, either from the following or from other initial weapon modifications to which you have access. These modifications grant additional weapon traits, sometimes with extra abilities. A modification might give your weapon the versatile trait with a damage type that the weapon could already deal, either from its base damage type or from an existing versatile trait. In that case, if you select that modification, you can instead choose to give the weapon the versatile trait for a different damage type: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Blunt Shot (Ranged Only)</strong> Your weapon innovation can file the edges off your ammunition and adjust the blunt force of the shot to deliver a bludgeoning attack when necessary, as well as to avoid striking a lethal blow with an otherwise deadly shot. Your innovation gains the nonlethal and versatile B traits. You can choose whether to apply the nonlethal trait on each attack with your innovation.</li>\n<li><strong>Complex Simplicity (Simple Weapon Only)</strong> Increase your innovation's weapon damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). In addition, it gains one of the following traits of your choice: versatile B, versatile P, or versatile S.</li>\n<li><strong>Dynamic Weighting (One-handed Melee Weapon Only; Can't Have the Agile, Attached, or Free-hand Trait)</strong> Your weapon's modified weight distribution can increase power in exchange for taking more hands to wield. Your innovation gains the two-hand trait, with a damage die one size higher than the weapon's normal weapon damage die size (for instance, a longsword would gain the two-hand d10 trait). Your innovation also gains the versatile B trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Entangling Form (Melee Only)</strong> You've altered your weapon to including tangling wires or straps, or to have a flexible construction. Your innovation gains the grapple and trip traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Hampering Spikes (Melee Only)</strong> You've added long, snagging spikes to your weapon, which you can use to impede your foes' movement. Your innovation gains the hampering and versatile P traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Hefty Composition (Melee Only)</strong> Blunt surfaces and sturdy construction make your weapon hefty and mace-like. Your innovation gains the shove and versatile B traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Modular Head</strong> You've constructed a multi-purpose, adjustable striking surface for your weapon, or you've made special ammunition you can swiftly alter. Your innovation gains the modular trait for bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. When you Interact to use the modular trait, you can also choose to give the weapon the nonlethal trait if it doesn't currently have it, or to remove that trait if it's currently nonlethal.</li>\n<li><strong>Pacification Tools (Melee Only)</strong> Softer materials make your weapon suited to knock out instead of kill, and special protrusions let you catch weapons and disarm your foes. Your innovation gains the disarm and nonlethal traits. You can choose whether to apply the nonlethal trait on each attack with your innovation.</li>\n<li><strong>Razor Prongs (Melee Only)</strong> You can knock down and slash your foes with sharp, curved blades added to your weapon. Your innovation gains the trip and versatile S traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Segmented Frame</strong> Hinges, clamps, and telescoping parts make your innovation collapsible and adjustable. It gains the modular trait for bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. You can Interact to collapse the item down to light Bulk or to return it to your normal form. When it's collapsed to light Bulk, it has the concealable trait, which grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks and DCs to hide or conceal the weapon.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Explode</h2>\n<p>Your innovation is a creation barely held together by your own engineering, always on the edge of completely falling apart. Though this adds risk, it also means you can coax it to perform far beyond its design specifications using special unstable actions. See the definition of the unstable trait and how it affects your innovation.</p>\n<p>While inventors can learn various unstable actions over their career, all at least know how to make their innovation Explode.</p>\n<h2>Peerless Inventor</h2>\n<p>You are constantly inventing, and your skill at crafting is unimpeachable. You gain the Inventor skill feat, even if you don't meet its prerequisites.</p>\n<h2>Shield Block</h2>\n<p>You gain the Shield Block general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.</p>\n<h2>Inventor Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level, you gain an inventor class feat. Some features and feats use an assortment of gizmos you keep on your person. For simplicity, these are left abstract, but if you are deprived of your gear for some reason, you might lose access to many feats and features, subject to GM discretion.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>Expert Overdrive<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You've increased your skill in crafting, and you can put your devices into a more powerful state of overdrive. You become an expert in Crafting, and on a successful use of Overdrive, you increase the additional damage by 1.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Reconfigure<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You've become an expert in all crafts and are always adjusting your inventions. You can attempt to change the modifications on your innovation by spending 1 day of downtime tinkering with it and attempting a Crafting check, with a high DC for your level. On a success, you can change one modification you've chosen for your innovation to a different modification of the same kind (initial, breakthrough, or revolutionary).</p>\n<p>If you have any modification feats, on a successful check you can choose to instead retrain a modification feat to a different modification feat. The new feat has to meet the standard restrictions for retraining.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase to either become trained in one skill you're untrained in, or become an expert in one skill in which you're already trained.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to become legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Inventor Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You develop tricks for using your weapons more effectively. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons and unarmed attacks increase to expert.</p>\n<p>If you have a weapon innovation, you gain access to the critical specialization effect with your innovation.</p>\n<h2>Breakthrough Innovation<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've made a breakthrough in your field of study and discovered a powerful new way to enhance your innovation. Choose a breakthrough modification of your innovation's type to apply to your innovation. You can choose an initial modification of your innovation's type instead if you prefer.</p>\n<h3>Breakthrough Armor Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Antimagic Plating</strong> Whether you used some clever adaptation of the magic-negating skymetal known as noqual or created magical protections of your own design, you've strengthened your armor against magic. While wearing the armor, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all saving throws against spells and to AC against spells. Against spells that target the armor directly (like heat metal), you instead gain a +4 circumstance bonus to all saving throws and to AC.</li>\n<li><strong>Camouflage Pigmentation (Subterfuge Suit Only)</strong> You've modified your armor's exterior to let you blend into your surroundings with ease, as long as you stay still. While wearing your armor, you can Hide even without cover or concealment, as the pigmentation shifts to match your surroundings.</li>\n<li><strong>Dense Plating</strong> You have encased your armor in robust plating. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to slashing damage equal to half your level.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Resistance</strong> You've improved upon your initial modification's ability to resist damage. The resistance from your initial armor modification adds your full level, instead of half your level (for instance, phlogistonic regulator's resistance would increase to your level). If you have more than one initial modification that gives resistance, choose which one this applies to.</li>\n<li><strong>Heavy Construction (Power Suit Only)</strong> You've expanded your innovation into a heavy bulwark, and your groundbreaking design ensures you don't take any of the drawbacks for such heavy defenses. Your innovation becomes heavy armor, and your proficiency in your innovation armor (but no other heavy armor) advances to be equal to your proficiency in medium armor. If your Strength score is at least 16, you remove the Speed penalty entirely instead of reducing it to -5 feet. The armor's adjusted statistics are: AC Bonus +5; Dex Cap +1; Check Penalty -2; Speed Penalty -10 feet; Strength 16; Bulk 3; Group composite; Armor Traits bulwark.</li>\n<li><strong>Hyper Boosters</strong> You've improved your speed boosters' power through a breakthrough that significantly increases the energy flow without risking exploding. You gain a +10-foot status bonus to your Speed, which increases to a +20-foot status bonus when you're in Overdrive. If you're legendary in Crafting, it instead increases to a +30-foot status bonus when you're in Overdrive. You must have the speed boosters modification to select this modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Layered Mesh</strong> You've woven an incredibly powerful network of interlocking mesh around your armor, which catches piercing attacks and diffuses them. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to piercing damage equal to half your level.</li>\n<li><strong>Tensile Absorption</strong> You've enhanced the tensile capabilities of your armor, enabling it to bend with bludgeoning attacks. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to bludgeoning damage equal to half your level.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Breakthrough Construct Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advanced Weaponry</strong> You've powered up your construct's weaponry. Choose one of your construct's unarmed attacks to gain your choice of one initial weapon modification, chosen from the list on page 18 or from other initial weapon modifications to which you have access. The unarmed attack must meet any requirements for the chosen traits (such as being a melee attack for entangling form), and since it's an unarmed attack, it can never meet certain requirements, such as being a simple weapon for complex simplicity.</li>\n<li><strong>Antimagic Construction</strong> Whether you used some clever adaptation of the magic-negating skymetal known as noqual or created magical protections entirely of your own devising, you've made your innovation highly resilient to spells. Your construct innovation gains a +2 circumstance bonus to all saving throws and AC against spells.</li>\n<li><strong>Climbing Limbs</strong> With appendages that can claw or create suction, your construct becomes a capable climber. Your innovation gains a climb Speed equal to half its land Speed.</li>\n<li><strong>Durable Construction</strong> Your innovation is solidly built; it can take significant punishment before being destroyed. Increase its maximum HP by your level.</li>\n<li><strong>Marvelous Gears</strong> Your innovation gains expert proficiency in Intimidation, Stealth, and Survival. For any of these skills in which it was already an expert (because of being an advanced construct companion, for example), it gains master proficiency instead. If you have the revolutionary innovation class feature, these proficiencies improve to master, or legendary if your construct innovation was already an expert. You must have the wonder gears modification to select this modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Turret Configuration</strong> Your innovation can transform from a mobile construct to a stationary turret. Your construct companion can transform as a single action, which has the manipulate trait, turning into a turret in its space (or transforming back from a turret into its normal configuration). While it's a turret, your innovation is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized}, but the damage die from its projectile launcher increases to 1d6 and the range increment increases to 60 feet. You must have the projectile launcher modification to select this modification.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Breakthrough Weapon Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advanced Rangefinder (Ranged Only)</strong> A carefully tuned scope or targeting device makes your weapon especially good at hitting weak points. Your innovation gains the backstabber trait and increases its range increment by 10 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Aerodynamic Construction (Melee Only)</strong> You carefully engineer the shape of your weapon to maintain its momentum in attacks against successive targets. Your innovation gains the sweep trait and the versatile S trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Inconspicuous Appearance (Melee Only)</strong> Your innovation is built for easy concealment and surprise attacks. It gains the backstabber and versatile P traits. If the weapon has light Bulk, it also gains the concealable trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Integrated Gauntlet (One-Handed Weapon Only; Can't Have the Two-Hand Trait)</strong> Combining your weapon with a gauntlet, you make it so you can quickly switch between attacking with your weapon and tinkering using your hands. Your innovation gains the free-hand trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Manifold Alloy</strong> You've devised several alloys that contain useful properties of various metals, and you replace a number of parts of your weapon or its ammunition with pieces from these alloys. Your weapon innovation is cold iron and silver. This means you deal more damage to a variety of supernatural creatures, such as demons, devils, and fey.</li>\n<li><strong>Rope Shot (Ranged Only)</strong> Your weapon can shoot projectiles that split into simple ropes or nets around your foes' legs to trip your targets, and you can climb using the grappling hooks built into the weapon. Your weapon innovation gains the climbing and ranged trip traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Tangle Line (Thrown Only)</strong> Your weapon has an extensible line that you can use to knock your enemies over and quickly recall the weapon back to your hand. Your innovation gains the ranged trip trait and the tethered trait.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Lightning Reflexes<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your reflexes are lightning fast. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Master Overdrive<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Your mastery of invention and crafting enhances your Overdrive even further. You become a master in Crafting, and on a successful Overdrive, you increase the additional damage by a total of 2, replacing the increase from expert overdrive.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Inventive Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Through innovation and experimentation, you've made your inventions more effective and reliable. Your proficiency rank for your inventor class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Offensive Boost<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You've made additions to your innovation to upgrade your offensive capabilities. Your improvements make any Strikes that rely on your innovation deal an additional 1d6 damage, with a type determined by the boost you choose. If your innovation is armor, the boost applies to your melee unarmed Strikes and to your melee Strikes with one weapon you choose during daily preparations; if your innovation is a construct, the boost applies to your construct companion's Strikes; and if your innovation is a weapon, the boost applies to your Strikes with your innovation. You can spend downtime to switch to a different boost in the same way as switching your modification. Choose one of the following boosts, with the damage type in parentheses.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chill (Cold)</strong> Your innovation rapidly absorbs heat, creating an intense chill.</li>\n<li><strong>Ignition (Fire)</strong> Your innovation shoots out jets of searing flame.</li>\n<li><strong>Jolt (Electricity)</strong> Your innovation jolts foes with charges of electricity.</li>\n<li><strong>Momentum (Bludgeoning)</strong> Your innovation slams into foes with added momentum.</li>\n<li><strong>Saws (Slashing)</strong> Your innovation reveals spinning sawblades during your attacks.</li>\n<li><strong>Spike (Piercing)</strong> Your innovation reveals wicked spikes during your attacks.</li>\n<li><strong>Vitriol (Acid)</strong> Your innovation releases spurts of caustic acid.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Medium Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to better defend yourself against attacks. Your proficiency ranks for light armor, medium armor, and unarmored defense increase to expert. If you have a medium or heavy armor innovation, you gain access to the critical specialization effect with your armor innovation.</p>\n<h2>Resolve<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've steeled your mind with resolve. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Will save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Alertness<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your attention to detail lets you remain alert to threats around you. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Complete Reconfiguration<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>When it comes to crafting and tinkering, you've become incredibly adept at changing your modifications to adjust your innovation's functionality. When you spend downtime to reconfigure your innovation and succeed at your Crafting check, you can swap any number of modifications, swap your offensive boost, or retrain any number of modification feats, rather than one. You still must swap a modification only with one of the same type (initial, breakthrough, or revolutionary).</p>\n<h2>Inventor Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You fully understand your weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons and unarmed attacks increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Legendary Overdrive<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your peerless inventing and Crafting ability has supercharged your Overdrives. You become legendary in Crafting, and on a successful Overdrive, you increase the additional damage by a total of 3, replacing the increase from master overdrive.</p>\n<h2>Revolutionary Innovation<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You are an unparalleled genius and have discovered a technique that will revolutionize your chosen field-or at least for the time being, your innovation! Choose a revolutionary modification to apply to your innovation. You can also choose an initial or breakthrough modification of the same type instead, if you prefer.</p>\n<h3>Revolutionary Armor Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Automated Impediments</strong> Your armor uses electromagnetic fields, subharmonic distortions, or other techniques to make it difficult for those close to you to move unless you allow it. While wearing your armor, all spaces adjacent to you are difficult terrain for your enemies.</li>\n<li><strong>Energy Barrier</strong> Your armor's defenses ablate any kind of energy coming your way. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to all energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, fire, force, negative, positive, and sonic damage) equal to 2 + half your level. You must have the harmonic oscillator, metallic reactance, or phlogistonic regulator modification to select this modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Incredible Resistance</strong> You've improved upon your breakthrough modification's ability to resist damage. Choose one of the following breakthrough modifications your innovation has: dense plating, layered mesh, or tensile absorption. Increase the resistance you gain from that modification to be equal to your level, instead of half your level.</li>\n<li><strong>Multisensory Mask (Subterfuge Suit Only)</strong> You've built a multisensory mask over your armor that protects you by distorting your figure from all senses, leaving behind only a hazy image, muffled sounds, and so forth. While wearing the armor, you gain concealment against all creatures, even if they are using a nonvisual precise sense, such as a bat's echolocation. As normal for effects that leave your location obvious, you can't use this concealment to Hide or Sneak. If you use a hostile action, the concealment ends until you restore the mask as a single action, which has the manipulate trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Perfect Fortification (Power Suit Only)</strong> You've outfitted your armor with such heavy fortifications that deadly attacks often lose their edge. Each time you're critically hit while wearing the armor, attempt a @Check[type:flat|dc:13|showDC:owner] check. On a success, it becomes a normal hit. This isn't cumulative with fortification runes or other abilities that reduce critical hits with a flat check. Additionally, you gain resistance 2 + half your level against precision damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Physical Protections</strong> Your armor has so many adjustments and precautions that it can guard against all physical damage. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to all physical damage (bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, as well as persistent bleed damage) equal to half your level. You must have the dense plating, layered mesh, or tensile absorption breakthrough modification to select this modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Rune Capacity</strong> Whether you've done some dabbling in orichalcum alloys or found another engineering solution, you've built your innovation in such a way that it can hold an additional property rune. Your innovation can have one more property rune than a normal item of its kind (to a maximum of four property runes with a +3 potency armor).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Revolutionary Construct Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flight Chassis</strong> You fit your construct with a means of flight, such as adding rotors or rebuilding it with wings and a lightweight construction. Your innovation gains a fly Speed of 25 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Miracle Gears</strong> As you perfect your innovation's cortex, it becomes much more intelligent. Its Intelligence modifier increases by 2, and it learns a language of your choice from among the languages you know. Your construct gains the ability to use actions that require greater Intelligence, like Coerce and Decipher Writing. Finally, your construct becomes legendary in two Intelligence- or Charisma-based skills of your choice. You must have the marvelous gears modification to select this modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Resistant Coating</strong> Your innovation is hard to damage by any means. It gains resistance 5 to all damage (except adamantine).</li>\n<li><strong>Runic Keystone</strong> You've incorporated a device similar to a runestone into your innovation, allowing it to hold a property rune, even though it isn't a weapon or suit of armor. An armor property rune affects your innovation itself if it would affect the wearer of the armor. A weapon property rune grants whatever properties it would normally grant to a weapon to your innovation's unarmed attacks, following all the requirements as normal (for instance, a vorpal rune would only apply to slashing melee unarmed attacks); if the rune affects only ranged attacks, it has no effect unless your innovation has a built-in ranged attack (from the projectile launcher initial modification, for example). If the rune would affect the physical shape or appearance of the weapon or armor itself, like glamered, the rune has no effect when etched into your construct.</li>\n<li><strong>Wall Configuration</strong> Your innovation can transform from a mobile construct to a stationary battlefield emplacement. It can unfold as a 2-action activity that has the manipulate trait, changing from its usual form into a thin, straight wall of metal and gears up to 10 feet tall and 30 feet long. The wall must extend through your innovation's original space. While your construct is a wall, it can't take any actions except to use the same activity to transform back, and it can't defend itself easily, making it @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Flat-Footed} and giving it an additional -2 status penalty to its AC. The wall blocks line of sight and effect unless your innovation has half its maximum HP or fewer, at which point holes in the wall allow creatures to see through and attack with cover, and Tiny creatures to slip through.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Revolutionary Weapon Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Attack Refiner</strong> Your weapon makes minute recalibrations after every missed attack to ensure the next lands true. Your innovation gains the backswing and shove traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Deadly Strike</strong> Through precise calculation, you've found the perfect shape for your weapon to deal extreme damage on a well-placed strike. Your innovation gains the deadly d8 trait. If your innovation was already deadly, it increases its deadly die to d12 instead of gaining deadly d8.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Damage</strong> You've made your innovation more powerful than other weapons of its kind. Increase your innovation's weapon damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). As normal, you can't increase your die by more than one size, so this modification isn't cumulative with complex simplicity.</li>\n<li><strong>Extensible Weapon (Melee only)</strong> You've found a way to construct your weapon so that it can extend while leaving its balance unchanged. Your innovation gains the reach trait. If the weapon already had the reach trait, it increases your reach by an additional 10 feet, instead of the usual additional 5 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Impossible Alloy</strong> Other inventors claim it's not even technically possible, but you've managed to create several metal alloys that seem to work for only you. These alloys can damage opponents vulnerable to any one of the seven skymetals. Your innovation is treated as all seven skymetals (abysium, adamantine, djezet, inubrix, noqual, orichalcum, and siccatite). This means you deal more damage to a variety of creatures, though you don't apply any of the other special effects for weapons made of those skymetals.</li>\n<li><strong>Momentum Retainer (Melee only)</strong> A special weighted device lets your weapon retain more of its momentum when you attack. Your innovation gains the forceful and versatile B traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Omnirange Stabilizers (Ranged only)</strong> You've modified your innovation to be dangerous and effective at any range. If your innovation had the volley trait, remove the volley trait. Otherwise, increase your innovation's range increment by 50 feet or an amount equal to the weapon's base range increment, whichever is more.</li>\n<li><strong>Rune Capacity</strong> Whether you've dabbled with orichalcum or found another engineering solution, you've built your innovation in such a way that it can hold an additional property rune. Your innovation can have one more property rune than a normal item of its kind (to a maximum of four property runes with a +3 potency weapon).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Inventive Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your inventions are incredibly effective.

These small folk live in the moment, and they prefer tall tales over factual records. The wars of a few decades ago might as well be from the ancient past. Misunderstood by other people, goblins are happy how they are. Goblin virtues are about being present, creative, and honest. They strive to lead fulfilled lives, rather than worrying about how their journeys will end. To tell stories, not nitpick the facts. To be small, but dream big.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Goblins have a reputation as simple creatures who love songs, fire, and eating disgusting things and who hate reading, dogs, and horses—and there are a great many for whom this description fits perfectly. However, great changes have come to goblinkind, and more and more goblins resist conformity to these stereotypes. Even among goblins that are more worldly, many still exemplify their old ways in some small manner, just to a more sensible degree. Some goblins remain deeply fascinated with fire or fearlessly devour a meal that might turn others' stomachs. Others are endless tinkerers and view their companions' trash as the components of gadgets yet to be made.</p>\n<p>Though goblins' culture has splintered radically, their reputation has changed little. As such, goblins who travel to larger cities are frequently subjected to derision, and many work twice as hard at proving their worth.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who is eccentric, enthusiastic, and fun-loving, you should play a goblin.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to prove that you have a place among other civilized peoples, perhaps even to yourself.</li>\n<li>Fight tooth and nail—sometimes literally—to protect yourself and your friends from danger.</li>\n<li>Lighten the heavy emotional burdens others carry (and amuse yourself) with antics and pranks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Work to ensure you don't accidentally (or intentionally) set too many things on fire.</li>\n<li>Assume you can't—or won't—read.</li>\n<li>Wonder how you survive given your ancestry's typical gastronomic choices, reckless behavior, and love of fire.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Goblins are stumpy humanoids with large bodies, scrawny limbs, and massively oversized heads with large ears and beady red eyes. Their skin ranges from green to gray to blue, and they often bear scars, boils, and rashes. Goblins average 3 feet tall. Most are bald, with little or no body hair. Their jagged teeth fall out and regrow constantly, and their fast metabolism means they eat constantly and nap frequently. Mutations are also more common among goblins than other peoples, and goblins usually view particularly salient mutations as a sign of power or fortune.</p>\n<p>Goblins reach adolescence by the age of 3 and adulthood 4 or 5 years later. Goblins can live 50 years or more, but without anyone to protect them from each other or themselves, few live past 20 years of age.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Goblins tend to flock to strong leaders, forming small tribes. These tribes rarely number more than a hundred, though the larger a tribe is, the more diligent the leader must be to keep order—a notoriously difficult task. As new threats rise across the Inner Sea region, many tribal elders have put aside their reckless ways in the hope of forging alliances that offer their people a greater chance at survival. Play and creativity matter more to goblins than productivity or study, and their encampments erupt with songs and laughter.</p>\n<p>Goblins bond closely with their allies, fiercely protecting those companions who have protected them or offered a sympathetic ear. Goblins tend to assume for their own protection that members of taller ancestries, which goblins often refer to colloquially as 'longshanks,' won't treat them kindly. Learning to trust longshanks is difficult for a goblin, and it's been only in recent years that such a partnership has even been an option. However, their attitude as a people is changing rapidly, and their short lifespans and poor memories help them adapt quickly.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Even well-intentioned goblins have trouble following the rules, meaning they're rarely lawful. Most goblin adventurers are chaotic neutral or chaotic good. Organized worship confounds goblins, and most of them would rather pick their own deities, choosing powerful monsters, natural wonders, or anything else they find fascinating. Longshanks might have books upon books about the structures of divinity, but to a goblin, anything can be a god if you want it to. Goblins who spend time around people of other ancestries might adopt some of their beliefs, though, and many goblin adventurers adopt the worship of Cayden Cailean.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>To some degree, almost every goblin is an adventurer, surviving life on the edge using skill and wits. Goblins explore and hunt for treasures by nature, though some become true adventurers in their own rights, often after being separated from their group or tribe.</p>\n<p>Goblins often have the acrobat, criminal, entertainer, gladiator, hunter, and street urchin backgrounds. Consider playing an alchemist, since many goblins love fire, or a bard, since many goblins love songs. As scrappy survivors, goblins are often rogues who dart about the shadows, though their inherently charismatic nature also draws them to the pursuit of magical classes such as sorcerer.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Goblins keep their names simple. A good name should be easy to pronounce, short enough to shout without getting winded, and taste good to say. The namer often picks a word that rhymes with something they like so that writing songs is easier.

you're always creating inventions, there's one that represents your preeminent work, the one that you hope- with refinement-might change the world. Choose one of the below innovations. Your innovation's level is equal to your level. If your innovation is destroyed, you can spend 1 day of downtime and attempt a Crafting check with a high DC for your level; on a success, you rebuild it. An innovation only works due to your constant maintenance and tinkering, and therefore has no market Price.</p>\n<p>The innovations you can choose from in this book are as follows.</p>\n<h3>Armor</h3>\n<p>Your innovation is a cutting-edge suit of medium armor with a variety of attached gizmos and devices. Choose one of the sets of statistics on Table 2-2: Innovation Armor Statistics for your innovation armor (or choose another set of innovation armor statistics to which you have access).</p>\n<p>Your innovation armor can have fundamental and property runes added to it in the same way as ordinary armor. Because of the unique features of your innovation, everyone except you is untrained in it, even if they would normally be trained (or better) in medium armor. Choose one initial armor modification to apply to your innovation, either from the following or from other initial armor modifications to which you have access.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Harmonic Oscillator</strong> You designed your armor to inaudibly thrum at just the right frequency to create interference against force and sound waves. You gain resistance equal to 3 + half your level to force and sonic damage. When under the effects of Overdrive, the resistance increases by 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Metallic Reactance</strong> The metals in your armor are carefully alloyed to ground electricity and protect from acidic chemical reactions. You gain resistance equal to 3 + half your level to acid and electricity damage. When under the effects of Overdrive, the resistance increases by 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Muscular Exoskeleton (Power Suit Only)</strong> Your armor supports your muscles with a carefully crafted exoskeleton. When you send your armor into overdrive, the exoskeleton supplements your feats of athletics as well. When under the effects of Overdrive, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Athletics checks; if you're a master in Crafting, this increases to a +2 circumstance bonus.</li>\n<li><strong>Otherworldly Protection</strong> Just because you use science doesn't mean you can't build your armor with carefully chosen materials and gizmos designed to protect against otherworldly attacks. You gain resistance equal to 3 + half your level to negative damage, or to positive damage if you have negative healing (such as if you're a dhampir). You gain the same amount of resistance to any types of alignment damage-good, evil, chaotic, lawful-that can damage you (note that creatures don't take a given type of alignment damage unless they are of the opposing alignment; for instance, you can take evil damage only if you are good in alignment).</li>\n<li><strong>Phlogistonic Regulator</strong> A layer of insulation within your armor protects you from rapid temperature fluctuations. You gain resistance equal to half your level to cold and fire damage. When under the effects of Overdrive, the resistance increases by 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Speed Boosters</strong> You have boosters in your armor that increase your Speed. You gain a +5-foot status bonus to your Speed, which increases to a +10-foot status bonus when under the effects of Overdrive.</li>\n<li><strong>Subtle Dampeners (Subterfuge Suit Only)</strong> You've designed your armor to help you blend in and dampen noise slightly. When you send your armor into overdrive, the dampeners increase their effect, improving your Stealth. When under the effects of Overdrive, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks. If you're a master in Crafting, this increases to a +2 circumstance bonus.</li>\n</ul>\n<table class=\"pf2-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Medium Armor</th>\n<th>AC Bonus</th>\n<th>Dex Cap</th>\n<th>Check Penalty</th>\n<th>Speed Penalty</th>\n<th>Strength</th>\n<th>Bulk</th>\n<th>Group</th>\n<th>Armor Traits</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Power Suit</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>-2</td>\n<td>-5 feet</td>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>composite</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Subterfuge Suit</td>\n<td>+1</td>\n<td>+4</td>\n<td>-1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>composite</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Construct</h3>\n<p>Your innovation is a mechanical creature, such as a clockwork construct made of cogs and gears. It's a prototype construct companion, and you can adjust most of its base statistics by taking feats at higher levels, such as Advanced Companion. If you use the Overdrive action, your construct gains the same Overdrive benefits you do, and it also takes the same amount of fire damage on a critical failure.</p>\n<p>You know how to spend additional time directing, controlling, or programming your construct innovation for a more complex plan of action. You can spend 2 actions to Command instead of 1 when commanding your construct companion; your construct companion can then use an additional action (normally 3 actions, rather than 2).</p>\n<p>Choose one initial construct modification to apply to your innovation, either from the following or from other initial construct modifications to which you have access. These modifications alter the construct's abilities or form.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Accelerated Mobility</strong> Actuated legs, efficient gears in the wheels or treads, or add-on boosters make your construct faster. Your innovation's Speed increases to 40 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Amphibious Construction</strong> Increased buoyancy, rudders, and a means of propulsion like a fluked tail or powerful propeller make your construct able to travel in water. Your innovation gains a swim Speed of 25 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased Size</strong> You built your construct innovation bigger than most. Your construct is Large. If you have this modification and your construct innovation becomes an advanced construct companion or otherwise gains the ability to become Large, you can immediately change increased size to a different initial construct modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Manual Dexterity</strong> Your construct innovation has articulated hands or similar appendages with significant manual dexterity. It can perform manipulate actions with up to two of its limbs. As normal for a companion, it still can't wield weapons or held items that don't have the companion trait, and it can't activate items.</li>\n<li><strong>Projectile Launcher</strong> Your construct has a mounted dart launcher, embedded cannon, or similar armament. Your innovation gains a ranged unarmed attack that deals 1d4 bludgeoning or piercing damage (you choose when you pick this modification). The attack has the propulsive trait and a range increment of 30 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Sensory Array</strong> Additional sensory devices give your innovation low-light vision and darkvision, as well as imprecise tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Wonder Gears</strong> You map specialized skills into your construct's crude intelligence. Your innovation becomes trained in Intimidation, Stealth, and Survival.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Weapon</h3>\n<p>Your innovation is an impossible-looking weapon augmented by numerous unusual mechanisms. It begins with the same statistics as a level 0 common simple or martial weapon of your choice, or another level 0 simple or martial weapon to which you have access. You can instead use the statistics of a 1st-level common simple or martial weapon of your choice, or another 1st-level simple or martial weapon to which you have access, but you must pay the monetary Price for the weapon. An innovation weapon can have fundamental and property runes added to it in the same way as an ordinary weapon. Because of the unique features of your innovation, everyone except you is untrained in it, even if they would normally be trained (or better) in simple or martial weapons. If you use the Overdrive action, you can choose to change the additional damage from Overdrive to fire damage. Choose one initial weapon modification to apply to your innovation, either from the following or from other initial weapon modifications to which you have access. These modifications grant additional weapon traits, sometimes with extra abilities. A modification might give your weapon the versatile trait with a damage type that the weapon could already deal, either from its base damage type or from an existing versatile trait. In that case, if you select that modification, you can instead choose to give the weapon the versatile trait for a different damage type: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Blunt Shot (Ranged Only)</strong> Your weapon innovation can file the edges off your ammunition and adjust the blunt force of the shot to deliver a bludgeoning attack when necessary, as well as to avoid striking a lethal blow with an otherwise deadly shot. Your innovation gains the nonlethal and versatile B traits. You can choose whether to apply the nonlethal trait on each attack with your innovation.</li>\n<li><strong>Complex Simplicity (Simple Weapon Only)</strong> Increase your innovation's weapon damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). In addition, it gains one of the following traits of your choice: versatile B, versatile P, or versatile S.</li>\n<li><strong>Dynamic Weighting (One-handed Melee Weapon Only; Can't Have the Agile, Attached, or Free-hand Trait)</strong> Your weapon's modified weight distribution can increase power in exchange for taking more hands to wield. Your innovation gains the two-hand trait, with a damage die one size higher than the weapon's normal weapon damage die size (for instance, a longsword would gain the two-hand d10 trait). Your innovation also gains the versatile B trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Entangling Form (Melee Only)</strong> You've altered your weapon to including tangling wires or straps, or to have a flexible construction. Your innovation gains the grapple and trip traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Hampering Spikes (Melee Only)</strong> You've added long, snagging spikes to your weapon, which you can use to impede your foes' movement.

Your innovation gains the shove and versatile B traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Modular Head</strong> You've constructed a multi-purpose, adjustable striking surface for your weapon, or you've made special ammunition you can swiftly alter. Your innovation gains the modular trait for bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. When you Interact to use the modular trait, you can also choose to give the weapon the nonlethal trait if it doesn't currently have it, or to remove that trait if it's currently nonlethal.</li>\n<li><strong>Pacification Tools (Melee Only)</strong> Softer materials make your weapon suited to knock out instead of kill, and special protrusions let you catch weapons and disarm your foes. Your innovation gains the disarm and nonlethal traits. You can choose whether to apply the nonlethal trait on each attack with your innovation.</li>\n<li><strong>Razor Prongs (Melee Only)</strong> You can knock down and slash your foes with sharp, curved blades added to your weapon. Your innovation gains the trip and versatile S traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Segmented Frame</strong> Hinges, clamps, and telescoping parts make your innovation collapsible and adjustable.

While wearing the armor, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to all saving throws against spells and to AC against spells. Against spells that target the armor directly (like heat metal), you instead gain a +4 circumstance bonus to all saving throws and to AC.</li>\n<li><strong>Camouflage Pigmentation (Subterfuge Suit Only)</strong> You've modified your armor's exterior to let you blend into your surroundings with ease, as long as you stay still. While wearing your armor, you can Hide even without cover or concealment, as the pigmentation shifts to match your surroundings.</li>\n<li><strong>Dense Plating</strong> You have encased your armor in robust plating. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to slashing damage equal to half your level.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced Resistance</strong> You've improved upon your initial modification's ability to resist damage. The resistance from your initial armor modification adds your full level, instead of half your level (for instance, phlogistonic regulator's resistance would increase to your level). If you have more than one initial modification that gives resistance, choose which one this applies to.</li>\n<li><strong>Heavy Construction (Power Suit Only)</strong> You've expanded your innovation into a heavy bulwark, and your groundbreaking design ensures you don't take any of the drawbacks for such heavy defenses. Your innovation becomes heavy armor, and your proficiency in your innovation armor (but no other heavy armor) advances to be equal to your proficiency in medium armor. If your Strength score is at least 16, you remove the Speed penalty entirely instead of reducing it to -5 feet. The armor's adjusted statistics are: AC Bonus +5; Dex Cap +1; Check Penalty -2; Speed Penalty -10 feet; Strength 16; Bulk 3; Group composite; Armor Traits bulwark.</li>\n<li><strong>Hyper Boosters</strong> You've improved your speed boosters' power through a breakthrough that significantly increases the energy flow without risking exploding.

You must have the speed boosters modification to select this modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Layered Mesh</strong> You've woven an incredibly powerful network of interlocking mesh around your armor, which catches piercing attacks and diffuses them. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to piercing damage equal to half your level.</li>\n<li><strong>Tensile Absorption</strong> You've enhanced the tensile capabilities of your armor, enabling it to bend with bludgeoning attacks. While wearing your armor, you gain resistance to bludgeoning damage equal to half your level.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Breakthrough Construct Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advanced Weaponry</strong> You've powered up your construct's weaponry. Choose one of your construct's unarmed attacks to gain your choice of one initial weapon modification, chosen from the list on page 18 or from other initial weapon modifications to which you have access. The unarmed attack must meet any requirements for the chosen traits (such as being a melee attack for entangling form), and since it's an unarmed attack, it can never meet certain requirements, such as being a simple weapon for complex simplicity.</li>\n<li><strong>Antimagic Construction</strong> Whether you used some clever adaptation of the magic-negating skymetal known as noqual or created magical protections entirely of your own devising, you've made your innovation highly resilient to spells. Your construct innovation gains a +2 circumstance bonus to all saving throws and AC against spells.</li>\n<li><strong>Climbing Limbs</strong> With appendages that can claw or create suction, your construct becomes a capable climber. Your innovation gains a climb Speed equal to half its land Speed.</li>\n<li><strong>Durable Construction</strong> Your innovation is solidly built; it can take significant punishment before being destroyed. Increase its maximum HP by your level.</li>\n<li><strong>Marvelous Gears</strong> Your innovation gains expert proficiency in Intimidation, Stealth, and Survival. For any of these skills in which it was already an expert (because of being an advanced construct companion, for example), it gains master proficiency instead. If you have the revolutionary innovation class feature, these proficiencies improve to master, or legendary if your construct innovation was already an expert. You must have the wonder gears modification to select this modification.</li>\n<li><strong>Turret Configuration</strong> Your innovation can transform from a mobile construct to a stationary turret. Your construct companion can transform as a single action, which has the manipulate trait, turning into a turret in its space (or transforming back from a turret into its normal configuration). While it's a turret, your innovation is @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.eIcWbB5o3pP6OIMe]{Immobilized}, but the damage die from its projectile launcher increases to 1d6 and the range increment increases to 60 feet. You must have the projectile launcher modification to select this modification.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Breakthrough Weapon Modifications</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Advanced Rangefinder (Ranged Only)</strong> A carefully tuned scope or targeting device makes your weapon especially good at hitting weak points. Your innovation gains the backstabber trait and increases its range increment by 10 feet.</li>\n<li><strong>Aerodynamic Construction (Melee Only)</strong> You carefully engineer the shape of your weapon to maintain its momentum in attacks against successive targets. Your innovation gains the sweep trait and the versatile S trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Inconspicuous Appearance (Melee Only)</strong> Your innovation is built for easy concealment and surprise attacks. It gains the backstabber and versatile P traits. If the weapon has light Bulk, it also gains the concealable trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Integrated Gauntlet (One-Handed Weapon Only; Can't Have the Two-Hand Trait)</strong> Combining your weapon with a gauntlet, you make it so you can quickly switch between attacking with your weapon and tinkering using your hands. Your innovation gains the free-hand trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Manifold Alloy</strong> You've devised several alloys that contain useful properties of various metals, and you replace a number of parts of your weapon or its ammunition with pieces from these alloys. Your weapon innovation is cold iron and silver. This means you deal more damage to a variety of supernatural creatures, such as demons, devils, and fey.</li>\n<li><strong>Rope Shot (Ranged Only)</strong> Your weapon can shoot projectiles that split into simple ropes or nets around your foes' legs to trip your targets, and you can climb using the grappling hooks built into the weapon. Your weapon innovation gains the climbing and ranged trip traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Tangle Line (Thrown Only)</strong> Your weapon has an extensible line that you can use to knock your enemies over and quickly recall the weapon back to your hand.

Cauthooj sightings typically lead to the creation of hunting parties to track the creature down before it can kill again, with would-be hunters typically stuffing their ears full of wax in an effort to avoid being affected by its cry.

Cauthoojs stalk the perimeter of remote settlements in hopes of finding a lone traveler they can feast upon. These patient creatures will wait in ambush as long as they must to sate their hunger.

They particularly enjoy conversations with humans and other civilized humanoids, delighting in the naive customs of these diminutive races without showing them haughtiness or scorn. While they may seem merely curious, brass dragons engage in this sort of conversation with the goal of keeping up to date on regional politics so they can anticipate future conflicts. Along the way, they create extensive information networks that begin with their own allies but stretch across all levels of humanoid society-networks which the brass dragon then uses to subtly assist settlements near their lair. Unlike the schemes and manipulations of blue dragons, brass dragons use their informant networks to establish justice and equality.</p>\n<p>These carefree dragons value independence and feel that all creatures deserve to live as they please, provided they don't harm others. They are emotional creatures and tend to have short attention spans, sometimes falling victim to depression in their twilight years. To combat this, some brass dragons keep pets and houseplants that they can care for.</p>\n<p>Though they may seem childlike in their curiosity concerning mortal affairs, a brass dragon's prowess in battle is no laughing matter. A brass dragon whose territory or allies are threatened is a terrifying foe indeed, quick to shed their innocent guise and unleash their terrifying might upon evildoers.</p>\n<p>Most brass dragons live in desert climates, and while they keep their lairs hidden, they often build near humanoid settlements.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Paragons of virtue, nobility, and grace, metallic dragons are benevolent entities revered as mythic beings akin to gods in both their power and majesty. Few have ever seen a metallic dragon firsthand, but tales of their intervention in mortals' lives-and of their passing-always spread far and wide. Named for the way their scales resemble the shining metals humanoids use in commerce, warfare, and industry, these immense beings are diverse in their interests and abilities, and they don't seem to mind being associated with such mundane materials. After all, to compare a gold dragon to a gold coin is like comparing an ocean to a glass of water-though they may seem similar at first glance, the raw power, breadth, and grandeur of one simply overwhelms the other. In addition to metallic dragons and their chromatic counterparts, other types of dragons roam the world and the rest of the multiverse. In the legendary lands of Tian Xia on the other side of the globe are the imperial dragons, serpentine beings who protect the cosmic balance and defend their ancient homeland. Outside the Material Plane, primal dragons such as the domineering brine dragon and reclusive cloud dragon shape the nature and goings-on of the Elemental Planes. Countless other types of dragons are sure to exist, including dragons on far-flung planes of existence and, it is rumored, primeval dragons who soar between the stars.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"darkvision, scent (imprecise) 60 feet, tremorsense (imprecise) 30 feet"},"traits":{"value":["dragon","fire"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","draconic","gnomish","halfling","sylvan"],"selected":[],"custom":"Speak With Animals"},"di":{"value":["fire","paralyzed","sleep"],"custom":""},"dr":[],"dv":[],"ci":[],"rarity":"common","size":{"value":"lg"}},"resources":{"focus":{"max":1,"value":1}},"schema":{"version":0.725,"lastMigration":null},"abilities":{"str":{"mod":5},"dex":{"mod":2},"con":{"mod":3},"int":{"mod":1},"wis":{"mod":1},"cha":{"mod":2}},"saves":{"fortitude":{"value":16,"saveDetail":""},"reflex":{"value":15,"saveDetail":""},"will":{"value":14,"saveDetail":""}}},"token":{"disposition":-1,"height":2,"img":"modules/qwert-fotrp/assets/token/young_brass_dragon.Token.webp?1646537053884","name":"Young Brass Dragon","width":2,"displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1},"color":null},"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{"pf2e":{"linkToActorSize":true},"monks-enhanced-journal":{"chatbubble":""}},"randomImg":false,"tint":null,"x":null,"y":null,"elevation":null},"items":[{"_id":"6evj7LX0P0Xyv3W8","data":{"description":{"value":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.725,"lastMigration":null},"ability":{"value":"cha"},"spelldc":{"value":17,"dc":25,"mod":0},"tradition":{"value":"arcane"},"prepared":{"value":"innate","flexible":false},"showUnpreparedSpells":{"value":true},"showSlotlessLevels":{"value":false},"proficiency":{"value":0},"displayLevels":{},"slots":{"slot0":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot1":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot2":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot3":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot4":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot5":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot6":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot7":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot8":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot9":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot10":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0},"slot11":{"prepared":[],"value":0,"max":0}},"signatureSpells":{"value":[]},"autoHeightenLevel":{"value":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/spellcastingEntry.svg","name":"Arcane Innate Spells","sort":100000,"type":"spellcastingEntry","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"GkuKYyD5W2XX5dpx","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>You can ask questions of, receive answers from, and use the Diplomacy skill with animals.

You gain the Attack of Opportunity reaction.</p>\n<p>@Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.O2MwufzEHbuThoGr]{Attack of Opportunity (Fighter)} <span class=\"pf2-icon\">R</span></p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening. Make a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If your attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, you disrupt that action. This Strike doesn't count toward your multiple attack penalty, and your multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.</p>\n<h2>Fighter Feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-numbered level thereafter, you gain a fighter class feat.</p>\n<h2>Initial Proficiencies</h2>\n<p>At 1st level you gain a number of proficiencies that represent your basic training. These proficiencies are noted at the start of this class.</p>\n<h2>Shield Block</h2>\n<p>You gain the @Compendium[pf2e.feats-srd.jM72TjJ965jocBV8]{Shield Block} general feat, a reaction that lets you reduce damage with your shield.</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>Bravery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>Having faced countless foes and the chaos of battle, you have learned how to stand strong in the face of fear and keep on fighting. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert. When you roll a success at a Will save against a fear effect, you get a critical success instead. In addition, anytime you gain the frightened condition, reduce its value by 1.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.</p>\n<h2>Skill Increases<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this increase either to increase your proficiency rank to trained in one skill you're untrained in, or to increase your proficiency rank in one skill in which you're already trained to expert.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, you can use skill increases to increase your proficiency rank to master in a skill in which you're already an expert, and at 15th level, you can use them to increase your proficiency rank to legendary in a skill in which you're already a master.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these ability boosts to increase your ability scores above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it's already 18 or above, or by 2 if it starts out below 18.</p>\n<h2>Ancestry Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>In addition to the ancestry feat you started with, you gain an ancestry feat at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Fighter Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>Hours spent training with your preferred weapons, learning and developing new combat techniques, have made you particularly effective with your weapons of choice. Choose one weapon group. Your proficiency rank increases to master with the simple and martial weapons in that group, and to expert with the advanced weapons in that group. You gain access to the critical specialization effects of all weapons for which you have master proficiency.</p>\n<h2>Battlefield Surveyor<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Whether taking stock of an enemy army or simply standing guard, you excel at observing your foes. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master. In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks for initiative, making you faster to react during combat.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you're a master, and to 4 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Combat Flexibility<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Through your experience in battle, you can prepare your tactics to suit different situations. When you make your daily preparations, you gain one fighter feat of 8th level or lower that you don't already have. You can use that feat until your next daily preparations. You must meet all of the feat's other prerequisites.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank for Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You have spent so much time wearing armor that you know how to make the most of its protection. Your proficiency rank for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to expert. You gain the armor specialization effects of medium and heavy armor.</p>\n<h2>Fighter Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>You've practiced your techniques to make them harder to resist. Your proficiency rank for your fighter class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Legend<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned fighting techniques that apply to all armaments, and you've developed unparalleled skill with your favorite weapons. Your proficiency ranks for simple and martial weapons and unarmed attacks increase to master. Your proficiency rank for advanced weapons increases to expert. You can select one weapon group and increase your proficiency ranks to legendary for all simple and martial weapons in that weapon group, and to master for all advanced weapons in that weapon group.</p>\n<h2>Evasion<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>You've learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, a dragon's breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you're an expert, 6 if you're a master, and 8 if you're legendary.</p>\n<h2>Improved Flexibility<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your extensive experience gives you even greater ability to adapt to each day's challenges. When you use combat flexibility, you can gain two fighter feats instead of one. While the first feat must still be 8th level or lower, the second feat can be up to 14th level, and you can use the first feat to meet the prerequisites of the second feat. You must meet all of the feats' prerequisites.</p>\n<h2>Armor Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>Your skill with armor improves, increasing your ability to prevent blows. Your proficiency ranks for light, medium, and heavy armor, as well as for unarmored defense, increase to master.</p>\n<h2>Versatile Legend<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 19</span></h2>\n<p>You are nigh-unmatched with any weapon. Your proficiency ranks for simple weapons, martial weapons, and unarmed attacks increase to legendary, and your proficiency rank for advanced weapons increases to master. Your proficiency rank for your fighter class DC increases to master.</p>"},"source":{"value":"Pathfinder Core Rulebook"},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":"fighter","schema":{"version":0.725,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-03-05T16:45:22.736+07:00","version":{"schema":0.72,"foundry":"9.254","system":"3.6.0.10666"}}},"keyAbility":{"value":["dex","str"]},"items":{"0c3e5":{"id":"F5VenhIQMDkeGvmV","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-legend.webp","level":13,"name":"Weapon Legend","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"2jey6":{"id":"bAaI7h937Nr3g93U","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/fighter-expertise.webp","level":11,"name":"Fighter Expertise","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"9c5ay":{"id":"x5jaCJxsmD5sx3KB","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/armor-expertise.webp","level":11,"name":"Armor Expertise","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"e1e4m":{"id":"eZNCckLzbH3GyncH","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/shield-block.webp","level":1,"name":"Shield Block","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"enizk":{"id":"W2rwudMNcAxs8VoX","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/improved-flexibility.webp","level":15,"name":"Improved Flexibility","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"ij943":{"id":"TIvzBALymvb56L79","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/battlefield-surveyor.webp","level":7,"name":"Battlefield Surveyor","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"lakjk":{"id":"GJKJafDGuX4BeAeN","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/bravery.webp","level":3,"name":"Bravery","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"lphi1":{"id":"OMZs5y16jZRW9KQK","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/juggerenaut.webp","level":9,"name":"Juggernaut","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"q0xyz":{"id":"CGB1TczFhQhdQxml","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/armor-mastery.webp","level":17,"name":"Armor Mastery","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"r6269":{"id":"hmShTfPOcTaKgbf4","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/attack-of-opportunity.webp","level":1,"name":"Attack of Opportunity","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"r6jbx":{"id":"MV6XIuAgN9uSA0Da","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/evasion.webp","level":15,"name":"Evasion","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"txlgu":{"id":"8g6HzARbhfcgilP8","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/combat-flexibility.webp","level":9,"name":"Combat Flexibility","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"u1d1r":{"id":"9EqIasqfI8YIM3Pt","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-specialization.webp","level":7,"name":"Weapon Specialization","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"u8k07":{"id":"gApJtAdNb9ST4Ms9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/fighter-weapon-mastery.webp","level":5,"name":"Fighter Weapon Mastery","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"vis8d":{"id":"Z7HX6TeFsaup7Dx9","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/greater-weapon-specialization.webp","level":15,"name":"Greater Weapon Specialization (Level 15)","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"},"x98c2":{"id":"0H2LxtiZTJ275pSD","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/versatile-legend.webp","level":19,"name":"Versatile Legend","pack":"pf2e.classfeatures"}},"hp":10,"trainedSkills":{"value":[],"additional":3},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":2,"reflex":2,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":2,"martial":2,"advanced":1,"unarmed":2,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":1,"medium":1,"heavy":1},"classDC":1,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]},"abilityBoostLevels":{"value":[5,10,15,20]}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"wgjTDLixUZ8YXqS9":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.classes.8zn3cD6GSmoo1LW4"},"pf2e":{"insertedClassFeaturesLevel":11}}},{"_id":"j5tm7tbei6q3w6wh","name":"Attack of Opportunity","type":"action","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/actions/Reaction.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within your reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>You lash out at a foe that leaves an opening.

Though many civilizations thrived before humanity rose to prominence, humans have built some of the greatest and the most terrible societies throughout the course of history, and today they are the most populous people in the realms around the Inner Sea.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Humans' ambition, versatility, and exceptional potential have led to their status as the world's predominant ancestry. Their empires and nations are vast, sprawling things, and their citizens carve names for themselves with the strength of their sword arms and the power of their spells. Humanity is diverse and tumultuous, running the gamut from nomadic to imperial, sinister to saintly. Many of them venture forth to explore, to map the expanse of the multiverse, to search for long-lost treasure, or to lead mighty armies to conquer their neighbors—for no better reason than because they can.</p>\n<p>If you want a character who can be just about anything, you should play a human.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Strive to achieve greatness, either in your own right or on behalf of a cause.</li>\n<li>Seek to understand your purpose in the world.</li>\n<li>Cherish your relationships with family and friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect your flexibility, your adaptability, and—in most cases— your open‑mindedness.</li>\n<li>Distrust your intentions, fearing you seek only power or wealth.</li>\n<li>Aren't sure what to expect from you and are hesitant to assume your intentions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Humans' physical characteristics are as varied as the world's climes. Humans have a wide variety of skin and hair colors, body types, and facial features. Generally speaking, their skin has a darker hue the closer to the equator they or their ancestors lived.</p>\n<p>Humans reach physical adulthood around the age of 15, though mental maturity occurs a few years later. A typical human can live to be around 90 years old. Humans often intermarry with people of other ancestries, giving rise to children who bear the traits of both parents. The most notable half-humans are half-elves and half-orcs.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Human variety also manifests in terms of their governments, attitudes, and social norms. Though the oldest of human cultures can trace their shared histories thousands of years into the past, when compared to the societies of the elves or dwarves, human civilizations seem in a state of constant flux as empires fragment and new kingdoms subsume the old.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Humanity is perhaps the most heterogeneous of all the ancestries, with a capacity for great evil and boundless good. Some humans assemble into vast raging hordes, while others build sprawling cities. Considered as a whole, most humans are neutral, yet they tend to congregate into nations or communities of a shared alignment, or at least a shared tendency toward an alignment. Humans also worship a wide range of gods and practice many different religions, tending to seek favor from any divine being they encounter.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>Unlike many ancestral cultures, which generally cleave to specific traditions and shared histories, humanity's diversity has resulted in a near-infinite set of names. The humans of northern tribes have different names than those dwelling in southern nation-states. Humans throughout much of the world speak Common (though some continents on Golarion have their own regional common languages), yet their names are as varied as their beliefs and appearances.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>A variety of human ethnic groups—many of which have origins on distant lands— populates the continents bordering Golarion's Inner Sea.

Humans and other ancestries have also been known to collect dinosaurs, be it to display them in menageries or keep them as exotic pets or guardians. Such activities are generally pursuits of the rich or eccentric, but certain druids and other guardians of nature feel strong kinships with dinosaurs as well and take them on as companions.

While their beaks are hooked to rip flesh from bone, their hunting strategy involves grabbing their prey in their powerful talons and then dropping it from great heights before feeding. This method creates a massive amount of carrion, which guarantees that rocs are followed by flocks of opportunistic scavengers, such as ravens and buzzards, who find it easy to steal bits of the larger birds' meals. Rocs, for the most part, don't mind these creatures, which sometimes get gobbled up along with the rest of the roc's food.</p>\n<p>Rocs usually nest among mountaintops and cliffs inaccessible to all but the bravest of terrestrial dwellers. They are long-range predators that hunt both land and sea in search for massive prey to sustain them and their young. Rocs are antisocial and lone hunters who compete with each other in fierce aerial battles to protect territory. But about once a decade, a mating couple pairs up to raise their chicks. Once the chicks are old enough to hunt on their own, the parents separate to once again engage in lone hunting.</p>\n<p>Particularly skilled druids or rangers might capture and train a roc to serve as a flying mount or hunting companion, though examples of such an incredible feat of domestication are few and far between. The easiest way to rear a roc is to do so from the moment it hatches, since the chick imprints on the first creature it sees. Acquiring a roc egg is by no means an easy feat, though, and is often a death sentence for the would-be egg-snatcher.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"low-light

Even when not making use of their acid, caustic monitors can be deadly predators: They grab onto smaller creatures using their powerful forelimb muscles and are remarkably agile, considering their size and weight.</p>\n<p>Most caustic monitors live among rocky terrain such as pebble beaches, natural caves, and along sandy river shoals. A caustic monitor's mucus corrodes only flesh, so its den is safe from damage, but corroded plant life near a cave is a telltale sign that a caustic monitor lives nearby.

Although a their small forelimbs are of little use other than to hold prey in place while the predators tear at their victim's flesh with their fearsome jaws, even these forelimbs bear sharp claws several inches long. As fearsome as tyrannosauruses are alone, they sometimes hunt in packs to take down massive prey. Only the most powerful creatures can successfully train tyrannosauruses, and even then, only when they can provide the ravenous beasts with a steady diet of meat.</p>\n<p>Some tribes of giants, particularly cyclopes or more obscure denizens of primeval lands, have even trained tyrannosauruses as mounts or beasts of war. In other places, xulgaths feed these prisoners to these mighty dinosaurs as part of executions or ritual sacrifices. Some xulgath cults even revere tyrannosaurs as incarnations of their violent demonic demigods. For their part, tyrannosaurs who have grown used to having their meals provided in this manner are remarkably well-behaved toward their feeders and keepers. Tyrannosauruses are 50 feet long and weigh 7 tons or more.</p>\n<p>Other variants of the tyrannosaurs include slightly smaller dinosaurs such as allosaurus, or even larger like ravenous giganotosaurus.

Their short, stubby wings may give them a comical appearance, but anyone who's been on the receiving end of the beast's powerful beak finds the experience less than amusing. Dromornis use their beaks to easily tear flesh and sinew from prey's bones, quickly dispatching sizable mammals like deer, tapirs, and primates. Particularly hungry or aggressive dromornises have even been known to attack humanoids. The bird's strong legs sport sharp talons that, while secondary in combat to its beak, can nonetheless trample and shred smaller creatures like rodents and amphibians caught underfoot.</p>\n<p>While a lone dromornis is dangerous enough, a pack of dromornises can take down a den of bears or village of humanoids. A dromornis pack typically consists of three or four adults and up to five juveniles, all of whom work in tandem to overpower larger prey. Packs lie in wait for something like an anaconda, boar, buffalo or, in cases of desperation, a dinosaur to emerge, then move as one for a surprise strike. Dromornises aren't particularly intelligent, but they have been known to use an ingenious (if hazardous) decoy tactic, luring in massive prey by putting one of their own fledglings at risk.</p>\n<p>Dromornises most often live in tropical jungles far from the reaches of civilization, though they sometimes make their homes in mountainside caves or along rocky coastlines. While most onlookers would be hard-pressed to tell one dromornis from another, dromornises maintain tight familial structures based on pheromones and scent glands, so it's obvious when a straggler from another family is trying to encroach on a pack's den. Such disputes over breeding grounds are common; a particularly prized dromornis den might change hands several times in the course of a year. Fights between dromornis packs are chaotic and swift, marked with the sounds of terrifying screeches and sprays of blood.</p>","privateNotes":""},"traits":{"senses":{"value":"low-light vision, scent

For example, a property that must be applied to a slashing weapon wouldn't function when you attacked with a fist, but you would gain its benefits if you attacked with a claw or some other slashing unarmed attack.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["agile","finesse","invested","magical","nonlethal","transmutation","unarmed"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[{"key":"Striking","predicate":{"all":["unarmed"]},"selector":"strike-damage"},{"key":"WeaponPotency","predicate":{"all":["unarmed"]},"selector":"attack"}],"slug":"handwraps-of-mighty-blows","schema":{"version":0.725,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-03-05T16:45:22.684+07:00","version":{"schema":0.72,"foundry":"9.254","system":"3.6.0.10666"}}},"quantity":{"value":1},"baseItem":null,"hp":{"value":0},"maxHp":{"value":0},"hardness":{"value":0},"brokenThreshold":{"value":0},"weight":{"value":"-"},"equippedBulk":{"value":""},"price":{"value":"35 gp"},"equipped":{"carryType":"worn","handsHeld":0,"inSlot":false},"stackGroup":{"value":""},"bulkCapacity":{"value":""},"negateBulk":{"value":"0"},"containerId":{"value":""},"preciousMaterial":{"value":null},"preciousMaterialGrade":{"value":null},"collapsed":{"value":false},"size":{"value":"med"},"identification":{"status":"identified","unidentified":{"name":"","img":"","data":{"description":{"value":""}}},"misidentified":{}},"usage":{"value":"worngloves"},"level":{"value":4},"invested":{"value":false},"category":"unarmed","group":"brawling","hands":{"value":""},"bonus":{"value":1},"damage":{"value":"","dice":1,"die":"d4","damageType":"bludgeoning"},"bonusDamage":{"value":0},"splashDamage":{"value":null},"range":null,"reload":{"value":""},"MAP":{"value":""},"potencyRune":{"value":1},"strikingRune":{"value":"striking"},"specific":{"value":false},"propertyRune1":{"value":null},"propertyRune2":{"value":null},"propertyRune3":{"value":null},"propertyRune4":{"value":null},"property1":{"value":"","dice":null,"die":"","damageType":"","critDice":null,"critDie":"","critDamage":"","critDamageType":"","criticalConditionType":"","criticalConditionValue":null,"strikeConditionType":"","strikeConditionValue":null}},"effects":[],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.FNDq4NFSN0g2HKWO"}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/equipment/worn-items/other-worn-items/handwraps-of-mighty-blows.webp","name":"+1 Striking Handwraps of Mighty Blows","sort":1000000,"type":"weapon","folder":null,"permission":{"default":0}},{"_id":"SDc0i4HEPHX9vIGF","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>These stiff leather armguards grant you a +1 item bonus to AC and saving throws, and a maximum Dexterity modifier of +5.

Clay golems have the power to lay curses upon their victims as punishment for intrusion, leading many to believe that these oft-ancient constructs have a touch of the divine to them. While this idea has little basis in reality, superstitious folk still tread lightly around statues that resemble clay golems even in the slightest.</p>\n<p>The animating force within a clay golem is unusually unstable, making the golem prone to entering a berserk frenzy when damaged. Entire treasuries have been totally ruined as a result of a rampaging clay golem, so crafters do well to make sure their golems are maintained and in good working order-or otherwise place them on the other side of the door from the treasures they wish to protect.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Crafted of base materials and then magically animated into a powerful guardian, the legendary golem is a living construct that mindlessly obeys its creator's commands-often continuing to do so for years or even centuries after its creator's death. There exist two known methods of animating a golem. The traditional method involves harvesting and implanting an elemental soul or essence within the newly crafted host statue, a procedure seen as vile and blasphemous to those who value the sanctity of the soul; evil or amoral golem crafters tend to prefer this method. The other, less disreputable technique involves siphoning pure positive energy into the statue to artificially imitate the creation of a soul. The result does not give the golem a true soul and is generally a more costly and time-consuming method of creation. Regardless of the method used, the resulting golem functions the same. A golem's unique animating force leaves it susceptible to certain forms of magic, but apart from these few weaknesses, it is impervious to magic and difficult to damage with weapons.</p>\n<p>Golems work best in play as foes to vanquish rather than allies to accompany player characters on adventures.
